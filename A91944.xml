         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THe Roman O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator tells us, <hi>Quod exemplo fit, jure fieri pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus;</hi> There are few Writers (humane or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) but they entitle their Labours, intended for Publique, to ſome particular Perſon whom they make choyce of, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Pattonize their Perſons and Works, (in which Caſe Wiſdome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
<pb facs="tcp:115536:3"/>them to ſome Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> one of high Place, and eminent Parts and Power; who is able to ſhelter them from the malice of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>Momus</hi>); Or to teſtifie thankfulneſſe, for ſome ſpecial benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: (and in that Caſe diſcretion guides them to pitch their thoughts on ſome ſingular Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor). The Community of the Act, may plead an Immunity for my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in going the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road of Writters. Yet I cloſe not with thoſe who crave Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; there is no need of that: for if it be Truth that I Preach and Print, it is God's, and needs no other Protector: If it be Error, all the Powers under Heaven are unable to ſupport it: That I aim principally at, in my Dedications, is, The Teſtification of a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, to thoſe, from whom I have received undeſerved kindneſſe; And in the number of thoſe, ſhould I forget you, I ſhould forget my ſelf.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115536:3"/>
               <p>To you Sir, I am many wayes obliged, for your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant favours, &amp; fruits of love, really expreſſed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then, when it pleaſed God moſt to darken my outward Eſtate. For three years ſpace I moſt comfortably enjoyed my Miniſtery, (through Gods goodneſs and Yours,) in that Pariſh where you now Dwell; all which time, I found your houſe to be both to me and mine, as the houſe of <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> was to <hi>Paul,</hi> a houſe of great refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.16.</note> The ſhadow of your Trees was to me, as <hi>Jonah</hi> his Gourd was to him,<note place="margin">Jon. 4.</note> very comfortable; but it pleaſed God to prepare a worme (what worme I will not ſay, but it went under the notion of an <hi>unknown Friend</hi>) which did ſmite my Gourd, and ſo gnaw the Stalk of my Shrowd, that it ſoon withered, to my grief.</p>
               <p>I, wanting thoſe means (whereby the World doth uſually teſtifie their thankfullneſſe to their Benefactors) deſire by this outward evidence, to
<pb facs="tcp:115536:4"/>give evidence to the World, of the inward diſpoſition of my heart, in preſenting to you, and ſending forth under your name, this <hi>Fruitleſſe Figg-Tree:</hi> The Title pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth little, yet, I hope under the Leaves thereof you will find ſome Fruit that will pleaſe your Religious palate.</p>
               <p>I cannot doubt, but that, as you were a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Hearer of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of mine, that hath formerly paſt the Preſſe, (which, <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> as it was paſſing by, you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in, and gave it friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertainment), ſo you will be a profitable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this, and give it Houſe-room and Heart-room; and ſeeing it comes unto you, under your own name, it will be a welcome Gueſt unto you. And my poor Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall accompany it, and follow you:</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115536:4"/>
               <p>The Lord ſo aſſiſt you with his Grace, that by this, and all other good means, you may grow from Grace to Grace; that ſo perfecting your Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the fear of God, you may be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every good work, to do his will; working in you that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.

But this, (as thou ſeeſt) is ſtept into the World before it: Yet know, that it is upon the birth, albeit, as yet, there is no ſtrength to bring it forth: I doubt not, but with God's aſſiſtance, thou ſhalt ſee, The Father's bleſſing to attend both on this, and that before mentioned.</p>
            <p>To you that have bin Hearers (in part or whole) of what is now ſet forth, I ſhall uſe the words of St. <hi>Paul, To write the ſame things to you,</hi> which you before have heard, <hi>to me it is not grievous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3.1.</note> 
               <hi>but for you it is ſafe:</hi> For to uſe the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> In this that I now write unto you, <hi>I ſtirr up your pure mindes by way of remembrance.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.2.</note> The beſt of us are dull to conceive, hard to believe, apt to forget, and ſlow to practiſe: Let our minds be never ſo pure, yet there is great need of ſtirring up: Dead Aſhes we ſtirr not up, but Embers, that be warm, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enkindle
<pb facs="tcp:115536:5"/>the live-coals that lye hid under them: When we lay on green wood, we blow the fire, and do not ſtirr it; when dry, we ſtirr the fire, and need not blow it: Proſelytes ſtand in need of kindling; well-improved Chriſtians of ſtirring up, and quickening. And ſuch I truſt you are, (if you be not, it is your ſhame:) God hath bleſſed you with the means for many years together; and, through the Religious care of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and conſcionable Patrons and Patroneſſes,<note place="margin">Dodding-Hurſt.</note> (for which this Place and Pariſh above many other have great cauſe of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe) there hath bin a ſucceſſion of godly and painfull Paſtors, who have bin ſet over you, to watch for your Souls; whoſe Labours God hath ſo bleſſed, that there is not (for any thing that I yet perceive at preſent) any Faction or Fraction amongſt you: No Papiſt, Anabaptiſt, Quaker; nor any ſuch like Schiſmatique: you live in amity and peace one wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h the other (generally); which is not ordinary, and, in theſe times, a ſingular mercy. And yet I fear, That charge which the Apoſtle layeth upon the Hebrews, may be layd on ſome of you: when as in regard of the long and plentiful means you have enjoyed, <hi>you ought to have bin Teachers</hi> (not Publique Preachers,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.12.</note> for that you ought not to be, but Teachers) to your Families, and one of another, in private communion; you had need to be taught the <hi>first Principles</hi> and Fundamentalls of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>It hath pleaſed God to bring me amongſt you, and give me a comfortable Call unto you: For, beſides the Nomination and free Preſentation of me to that Place, by the Godly and Judicious Patron; I was acquainted with the joynt, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous deſire of you all, (which you teſtified under your hands, by way of petition to the Patron, that he would pitch his thoughts upon me), that I might be your Paſtor; This indeed, made me (it being undeſired) much more willing to undertake this Charge, which otherwiſe (I believe) I ſhould hardly have bin drawen unto; And now, having undertaken it, I deſire God's aſſiſtance, and your prayers, that I may be found faithful therein,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.1. Phil. 1.9, 10, 11.</note> whilſt it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to continue me amongſt you; <hi>And that the Word may have free paſſage, and be glorified in us,</hi> and by us, both Miniſter and People: And this <hi>I pray
<pb facs="tcp:115536:6"/>that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all Judgment, that you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be ſincere, and without offence till the day of Chriſt, being filled with the fruits of Righteouſneſſe, which are by Jeſus Christ, unto the glory and praiſe of God:</hi> I ſhall ſecond my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with my beſt endeavours. Read diligently what you have heard, apply conſcionably what you read and hear, and bring forth fruit accordingly: ſo ſhall we one day rejoyce in this (both I and you), that we have not heard in vain, nor laboured in vain.</p>

            <p>This ſilent Objection Chriſt gives an anſwer unto, in the Parable now read, reſembling God unto a Husbandman;<note place="margin">The Scope.</note> who having a barren and fruitleſſe Figg-tree growing in his Vineyard, from which after much pains and coſt beſtowed on it, and ſome fruitful return with much patience expected, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding none, he expoſtulates with his ſervant about the ſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and barrenneſſe thereof, giving him a charge to cut it down, or ſtub it up, that it may no longer take up that room
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115536:13"/>in his Vineyard, whereon a more fruitful plant might grow. But the Dreſſer of the Vineyard (his ſervant) being grieved, that ſo goodly a tree (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is your caſe (ſaith Chriſt.) and the caſe of the whole Jewiſh Nation: God hath choſen you to be a peculiar people to himſelf; He hath planted you in a rich and fruitful ſoyle, flowing with milk and honey: He hath ſent his ſervants amongſt you, who in no good point of Husbandry have bin wanting to you; and, with much patience, hath long expected ſome anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble return of fruitful obedience from you; which not finding, he long ſince paſt ſentence againſt you, and reſolved upon your utter extirpation and ruine: But through the earneſt prayers and ſupplications put up unto him by his Servants and Prophets on <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> behalf, he hath hitherto ſpared you, proving if at leaſt, now at laſt, you will bring forth fruit meet for Repentance: which if you do, it will be well for you; but if not, no priviledge will exempt you from the ſtroak of Vengeance. And thus we have acquainted you both with the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of propounding this Parable, and with our Saviour's <hi>Scope</hi> and drift in the propounding of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the next place cut out my work, and lay before you the ſeveral parts and members of it.</p>
            <p>The Parts are Generally two,<note place="margin">The Parts.</note> the <hi>Preface,</hi> and the <hi>Parable</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preface</hi> we have in theſe words of the Evangeliſt; <hi>He ſpake alſo this Parable,</hi> intimating a <hi>Reference</hi> to what went before, in that Particle <hi>[Alſo],</hi> And the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> which followes after, <hi>He ſpake this Parable.</hi> Where we may take notice of the <hi>Doctor</hi> or Teacher <hi>[He ſpake],</hi> And then the <hi>Doctrine</hi> or leſſon taught <hi>[This Parable].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Parable</hi> it ſelf, is firſt <hi>Propounded,</hi> A <hi>certain man had a Figg-tree,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 6. And then <hi>Proſecuted, verſ.</hi> 7.—10.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Propounding</hi> part, we have the <hi>Subject</hi> and the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate</hi> conſiderable.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:115536:13"/>
            <p>The <hi>Subject,</hi> A <hi>certain man had a Figg-tree planted in his Vineyard;</hi> And there the <hi>Owner,</hi> and his <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Owner,</hi> A <hi>certain man,</hi> where we ſhall ſhew you, firſt, who he was, A <hi>man:</hi> 2d what he was, A <hi>Vinitor</hi> or Husbandman;</p>
            <p>His <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> he <hi>had a Figg-tree planted in his Vineyard,</hi> notifying firſt the <hi>Nature</hi> of his Inheritance in <hi>General,</hi> [A <hi>Vineyard</hi>]: For <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> one, A <hi>Vineyard,</hi> not <hi>Vineyards;</hi> and for <hi>Property, [His.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Plant</hi> of note in <hi>ſpecial</hi> thereon growing, which is ſet forth by its <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>quality:</hi> for <hi>kind Generally,</hi> A <hi>Tree; ſpecifically,</hi> a <hi>Figg-tree.</hi> And for <hi>Quality:</hi> No wilde one but <hi>planted,</hi> (ſuch was its Original); and that in no barren ſoyle, but in the <hi>Vineyard</hi> before mentioned, there was its ſite or placing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Predicate, [He came and ſought fruit thereon, and found none.]</hi> And there we have to take notice, firſt of the Owners <hi>Viſitation</hi> of that his Vineyard and Figg tree, <hi>he came</hi> unto it: ſecondly of his <hi>Expectation</hi> from it, <hi>[he ſought fruit thereon, but found none];</hi> fruit he ſought, none he found.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proſecution</hi> of this Propoſition we have, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.8, 9. And therein, an <hi>Expostulation</hi> with the Dreſſer of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyard about the ſterility of that Figg-tree, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of the Dreſſer made for it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.9.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Expoſtulatory</hi> part obſerve we, firſt the <hi>Perſon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulating,</hi> the Owner of that Figg-tree, <hi>Then ſaid he:</hi> And <hi>Expoſtulated with,</hi> the Dreſſer of his Vineyard: <hi>Then ſaid he unto the Dreſſer of the Vineyard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>ſubstance</hi> of it, [<hi>Behold theſe three years I come</hi> &amp;c.] Wherein we have firſt a <hi>ſad Complaint, Behold theſe three years I come ſeeking fruit on this Figg-tree and find none.</hi> Secondly, A <hi>ſevere ſentence, [Cut it down, why cumbers it the ground?]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Complaint,</hi> we cannot but take notice of the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of it. The <hi>manner [Behold]</hi> calling for ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial attention and obſervation. The <hi>matter</hi> declared in theſe words <hi>[Theſe three years I come ſeeking fruit on this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115536:14"/>Figg-tree, and find none</hi>] where the <hi>Grievance</hi> [Barrenneſs] The <hi>Aggravation</hi> from the <hi>Time</hi> [three years] and from the <hi>coſt</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> beſtowed on it, implyed in theſe words [<hi>The Figg tree</hi>] this which I my ſelf planted, and that in mine own Vineyard where nothing is wanting that might conduce to fruitfulneſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſevere Sentence</hi> follows, <hi>Cut it down, why Cumbers it it the Ground?</hi> where the <hi>Object</hi> doomed, <hi>[It]</hi> that is, the Figg tree before mentioned; And the <hi>Doom</hi> it ſelf, <hi>[Cut it down]</hi> ſhewing the <hi>ſeverity</hi> of it, not lopp it, prune it, but Cut it down at the very Root, wholly extirpate it. And the <hi>Equity</hi> thereof expreſſed by way of <hi>Interrogation, [Why cumbers it the ground?]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Interceſſion</hi> made for this Figg-tree follows, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>And he anſwering ſaid unto him, Lord let it alone this year alſo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Where we have obſervable, firſt the <hi>Perſons interceding, [he ſaid], Interceeded; [Lord]:</hi> Secondly, The <hi>Requeſt</hi> made, <hi>Let it alone,</hi> &amp;c. And there,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Thing Requested,</hi> which is <hi>Specified [Let it alone]</hi> forbear it a while longer, and then <hi>Exemplyfied</hi> and enlarged from the <hi>Time [this year alſo.]</hi> And from the <hi>End</hi> [till I <hi>ſhall digg about it and dung it</hi>] that it may become fruitful. This was his Aime in General,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Termes</hi> or Conditions in ſpecial on which this Requeſt is made, which are twofold; one on <hi>his part</hi> that was the Dreſſer of it, <hi>[I will dig about it and dung it,]</hi> I will beſtow more paines upon it then heretofore I have done, if thou wilt be pleaſed to let it ſtand one year longer.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>on the behalf of the Figg-tree,</hi> which hath two branches, the one <hi>Affirmative, [If it bear fruit, Well]:</hi> The other <hi>Negative, [If not, then after that thou ſhalt cut it down.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Former hath in it a <hi>Suppoſition [If it bears fruit]</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it do ſo; Then a <hi>Determination [Well]</hi> there is no more to be ſaid (which albeit it be not expreſſed in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, yet it is implyed). In the latter we have an <hi>Addubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>ſuſpition [If not]</hi> he could not ſay it would; And a <hi>Conceſſion</hi> in Caſe it did not, <hi>[After that thou ſhalt cut it down,]</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:115536:14"/>I will give way to the ſentence, and no more ſpeak in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of it.</p>
            <p>And thus I have laid before you the ſeveral parts &amp; branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of this excellent Parable, which albeit it concerns a fruitleſs and barren Figg-tree, whereon the owner could not find ſo much as one Figg growing,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 35.</note> yet (as <hi>Solinus</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Aegyptian Figg tree</hi>) we ſhall find it richly loaden with wholeſome Doctrine, and heavenly inſtruction; bearing fruit not onely on the main <hi>ſtock</hi> and <hi>body</hi> of it, (which is the principal ſcope,) but on every <hi>branch</hi> and <hi>twigg</hi> thereof; which being wiſely gathered, and with the hand of Faith plucked and applyed, ſhall (I hope) nouriſh our ſouls with much ſweetneſſe.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſpeaks of all Scripture generally, may be truly ſaid of <hi>Parables</hi> more particularly; they have in them <hi>&amp; quod robuſtus comedat, &amp; quod parvulus ſugat,</hi> Meat for great ones, and Milk for weak ones: That which makes for the nouriſhment of weak ones, <hi>habet in publico</hi> (ſaith he); that which makes for the nouriſhment of the ſtronger, <hi>habet in ſecreto.</hi> Three things in every Parable are Principally conſiderable, <hi>Cortex, Radix, Fructus;</hi> The firſt is the <hi>Rind</hi> or Bark, the words or terms in which it is delivered, or the thing from which the Similitude is taken: The ſecond is the <hi>Root,</hi> The Intention or purpoſe of the Parable, The drift or ſcope of it, beyond which the ſimilitude may not be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: The third is the <hi>Fruit</hi> or profit, which is to be gathered from it, and that ariſeth from both the former (for the very Letter of the Parable will afford ſome good matter for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meditation). But in the Letter we may not reſt: the Rind is modeſty to be put aſide, the Vaile is to be drawn, and the ſpiritual Senſe is eſpecially to be peruſed.

            <p>The <hi>Cutting down</hi> of this Figg-tree, (as it reſpected the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Synagogue</hi> and ſtate) ſets forth the <hi>utter ſubverſion and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of it,</hi> with the deſtruction of the City and Temple by the <hi>Romans:</hi> But as it <hi>concerns us,</hi> ſo it notes the <hi>Lord's rejecting</hi> and caſting off a people for their barrenneſſe, according to that we read,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.8.</note>

            <p>The <hi>year,</hi> craved for ſparing of it in <hi>reſpect of the Jews,</hi> is thought by ſome to be that <hi>very year</hi> when as Chriſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Parable unto them, which was the fourth current of his publique Preaching; but better they, who underſtand it of the <hi>time of the Apoſtles preaching</hi> amongſt them after Chriſt's death, and before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem: One year</hi> put for <hi>forty</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cajetan</hi>).

When the Diſciples were put in mind by the two Angels, of the words of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 24.6, 8.

            <p>This tends to the Juſtification of the practiſe of ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as repeat to their Auditory, what they before have heard and learned, and ſometimes inſiſt ſomewhat long and largely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an uſeful point. Seeing they do but imitate their Lord and Maſter herein, they need not be aſhamed of ſo doing. What we have ſaid before, we may warrantably ſay again, and repeat and beat upon the ſame Doctrine, till we perceive that our Hearers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115536:17"/>do rightly underſtand it, and are affected with it: Holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are not like tricks done by ſlight of hand, to be ſhewed but once, for fear that what is admired at firſt, upon a ſecond ſhewing will become ridiculous; but, the oftener they are taught, the better (uſually) they will be underſtood and lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Yet this tends not to excuſe any mans Ignorance,<note place="margin">Praeoccu.</note> who is not able to Preach ſeaſonably, and to break and diſtribute the bread of life according to the emergent neceſſities of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at that time: nor is it intended to excuſe any man's idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and lazineſſe, that will not imploy his time, his whole time upon his ſtudy, but is enforced through a willful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted neceſſity, to Preach the ſame thing again and again, that he Preached before; He is not a Preacher ſufficiently qualified that doth ſo:<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Donne.</hi>
               </note> but this I ſay withall (ſaith a Learned Doctor) that he is not a Preacher ſufficiently diſcreet, that forbears the preſſing of any neceſſary point, becauſe himſelf or ſome other before him hath handled that before. Did not the Prieſts walk with the ſame Ark upon their ſhoulders every day,<note place="margin">Joſ. 6.3.</note> once for ſix daies together, about the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> and on the ſeaventh day they compaſſed thoſe walls ſeaven times before they fell?<note place="margin">2 King. 13.18.</note> Was not the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> commanded to ſmite the ground again and again, and blamed for ſtriking it no oftener, albeit he had ſtruck it thrice? It is not once plowing, but the often breaking of the earth that makes it fruitful; ſo not once ſpeaking but often urging, and frequent inculcating of divine truths that proves ſucceſſeful: Reverend and learned <hi>Melanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> found this to be true, which cauſed him to go over the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> tend ſeverall times in his ordinary Lectures.</p>
            <p>And yet in ſeeking the profit of our Hearers, care muſt be had,<note place="margin">caution.</note> that we clogg not their Stomacks, and marr their Appetites, (which may ſoon be done if the greater care be not had). There is <hi>Defatigatio in Intellectualibus,</hi> the ſould may be wearied and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as well as the body: <hi>Haſt thou found honey, eat ſo much as is ſufficient for thee,</hi> (ſaith Solomon) <hi>lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 25.16. <hi>R. Moſes.</hi>
               </note> Upon which words an Hebrew Rabbin hath this Note, It is not ſaid, that if thou beeſt cloyed with it, thou mayeſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115536:18"/>diſtate it afterward, or be diſaffected towards it; but thou mayſt vomit it, and a vomit works ſo, that it doth not onely bring up what was then eaten, but what was formerly taken, and in the Stomack, and we may apply it to the point in hand: Give we muſt of that honey which we have found, to ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but not to the ſurfet of our Auditory, leſt it cauſe them not only to vomit up, what is then of that point delivered, but take a diſtaſte, yea a loathing of all the reſt that they have heard from us.</p>
            <p>And this may happen either by a frequent and diſorderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating of the ſame thing, (which uſually is occaſioned throught want of method, or want of matter) or by an overlong inſiſting upon ſome truth, which being known, makes little or nothing to the Edification of the Hearer.</p>
            <p>Some things muſt needs be recalled, by the Miniſter in Preaching, to guide the attention of his Auditory, into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing diſcourſe; but the attention of an Auditory, may not be diſcouraged with needleſſe Tautology or Battology, nor tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repetition of the ſame thing that hath bin often ſaid before. It is not commendable when a Miniſter, with the Clock ſhall tell all that was told many hours before, and content himſelf for that time, but with one ſtroak more; rather, as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s brethren upon their return to their brother,<note place="margin">Gen. 43.15. Jer. 36. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> brought double money in their Sacks mouths; and as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> added in the ſecond role many words like unto the former. So ſhould a Miniſter in his Repetitions, add to what was before delivered: Something (it may be) needs clearer explanation, and ſomething better confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; And ſomething, it may be, upon the firſt delivery ſlipt the memory: Now as in payment of money, if what was overſeen in the firſt telling, be made up in the ſecond; ſuch a drawing over will not be very grievous either to the Creditor, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
            <p>And it is likewiſe neceſſary, that ſome truths ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener inculcated, and longer inſiſted on then others, (according to the Doctrine that you have heard) but it would be,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> his Right mans Plea. <hi>Ser. 5.</hi>

And there are others which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſound and good, yet they are too intricate and high for an Auditory of a mean capacity; which a Miniſter (albeit his Text giveth him an occaſion to deal withal) may with good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, forbear largely to inſiſt upon, <hi>John</hi> 16.12.<note place="margin">John 16.12.</note> But there are other divine truths which are neceſſary to be known of all, being of daily riſe, either for the ſtabliſhment of Faith, or practiſe of Life; the ſtate and wellfare of the ſouls of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, doth very much depend on the frequent iteration and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcation of them; nor will the Stomach of the Hearer be ſo ſoon cloyed with theſe, as with other.</p>

               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> preached many Sermons to his people of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> againſt ſwearing; his Auditory began to be weary of that ſubject and asked him, When he would leave Preaching againſt that ſin and chooſe ſome other Subject to diſcourſe of? He told them, that when they had left Swearing, he would leave Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt it, and not before. And I have read of an Epigram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſt, who reading his Poems and Epigrams in a certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, one of his Hearers interrupted him, ſaying, This is an old one, I heard it from you the laſt year.

If your curioſity bring you to ſay to any Preacher, I have heard this Doctrine handled by you before; this Text, or this Sermon on that Text preached by you a year or two ago. You did ſo, may he ſay, and you may hear it again the next year, and the next to that; till it appear by your amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you did hear it, you may hear it often. So long as the Devil fights with the ſame ſword, give us leave to defend with the ſame Buckler; whilſt he doth not vary the ſin, nor the temptation, but tempts the Son to the ſame wickedneſſe that he did the Father, the Daughter to the ſame uncleanneſſe that he did the Mother; what need we vary the Doctrine?</p>
            <p>Away then with that niceneſſe, with that itch of the ear which the Apoſtle complaines of,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.3.</note> to whom any reiteration, any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſame thing (be it never ſo uſeful) is yrkſome and faſtidious: <hi>Peter</hi> was greived becauſe our Saviour ſaid the third time <hi>Loveſt thou me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 21.17.</note> We ought not to be ſo; we may not be offended at the often inculcating and frequent preſſing of the ſame truth, ſeeing for us <hi>it is a ſure thing.</hi> Make the right uſe of it,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.1.</note> ſay not, If I had thought to have heard the ſame again; I would not have come to Church to day, I knew this before, have heard this often: But commune with thine own ſoul ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after this manner; I thought indeed that I had bin ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently iuſtructed in this point, but I find it otherwiſe, God ſees that I have not enough learned it, and that I muſt make ſome better uſe of it, he will not have me to take out, turn over
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115536:19"/>another leaf, nor take out a new leſſon, till I have learned the old one better. I will hear it as if I never heard it, read it as if I never had read it before: It is Gods deſire to faſten that nayl, which he knocks in with ſo many hammers.</p>
            <p>As we have taken out this leſſon from Chriſt's method or <hi>Manner</hi> of Preaching, in preſſing and inculcating his Doctrine on his Hearers; ſo from the <hi>Matter</hi> preſſed, ſomething might be obſerved.</p>
            <p>When things are much urged and ingeminated, in Scripture, uſually three things are imported (as concerning the matter that is preſſed on us): One is the Difficulty, another the Neceſſity, the third is the Excellency thereof.

And this fair Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the death of her Mother; ſhe killed her that bred her, and was bleſſed for ſo doing: She was no ſooner born but ſhe ſpake, and did declare her own deſires, and ever after doth work miracles; She makes the blind to ſee, the deaf to hear, the dumb to ſpeak, and caſts out Devils: She looks backward, and moves forward; is her ſelf a dark Cloud, yet brings a fair Sun ſhine: Is this a Riddle to you? I will read it: Sin is the Mother, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the Daughter, the Mother is black and ugly, the Daughter fair and lovely: God is the Father of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and He could never endure the Mother ſin, but hates her ſociety; being born ſhe ſlew her Mother, for by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſin is ſlain, and in ſo doing God doth bleſſe her; ſhe no ſooner receives breath, but ſhe cryes for pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115536:20"/>Miracles ſhe works: the blind eyes are by her made to ſee the filthyneſſe of ſin; the deaf ear ſhe cauſeth to hear the word of truth, the dumb lips to cry out for grace, and the heart that was dead, becomes now alive to God, and the Devil that ruled in it is now expelled; She looks backward to ſins paſt, and is humbled for them, yet ſhe moves forward to holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and perfection. In ſhort, Repentance is her ſelf cloudy, and made up of ſadneſſe, yet everlaſting joy and happineſſe doth attend it.</p>
            <p>But this is too large a ſubject for me to diſcourſe upon, from ſo little warning as my Text gives, and yet were it not that I have pitched my thoughts upon another Text, which requireth a larger handling of this Doctrine; I would ſpend theſe few minutes that remain, in enlarging of the former particulars; wiſhing that the voice of this Turtle were more heard in our Land, that Gods faithful Miniſters would not forbear Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; nor the people ever leave practiſing it, till God be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed withall, to turn away his wrath from us, which yet hovers over our heads, as ſome birds do over their prey.

            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Allegories</hi> and <hi>Poetical fictions,</hi> are likewiſe accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Parables: ſo, that fiction of the Trees aſſembling together to chooſe them a King,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.7.</note> 
               <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.9. is termed <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Any <hi>Compariſon</hi> or <hi>Similitude</hi> fetched from things earthly, to help our underſtanding in things heavenly, are ſo ſtyled.<note place="margin">Math. 13.53.</note> So, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.59.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Compariſons</hi> drawen from <hi>mens actions</hi> and <hi>manners,</hi> theſe are more ſtrictly and properly termed Parables; For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſimilitudes and Parables ſeem in Scripture to be <hi>Synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes,</hi> yet there is a difference.<note place="margin">

               </note> For, a <hi>Similitude</hi> is more <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> A <hi>Parable more ſpecial;</hi> In every Parable there is a Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and comparing of two things together, (as the notation of the word imports) but every ſuch Collation and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon cannot properly be termed a Parable: A ſimilitude may be drawen from any thing in nature, but a Parable (ſtrictly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115536:25"/>taken) onely from humane actions or doings, and ſuch a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is this which our Saviour at this time ſpake.</p>
            <p>Of Parables, ſome are <hi>Perfect,</hi> and ſome <hi>Imperfect;</hi> Perfect, where the Expoſition is added, ſuch are the Parables of the Sower, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.3, 18. And of the Tares,<note place="margin">Math. 13.3, 18, &amp; 24, 57.</note> 
               <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.5, 7. But there are others (and ſo the moſt are) barely propounded, but not expounded (in which reſpect they are termed Imperfect), the bread whereof we muſt eat with the ſweat of our browes or braines; we muſt ſearch them diligently, and deſcend into the bowels of them, as we do into the bowels of the Earth to find out ſilver;<note place="margin">Prov. 2.4.</note> we muſt digg as for <hi>hid treaſure</hi> to find out the ſpiritual meaning, which with a ſleight obſervance or ſuperficial diligence cannot be attained: And yet of this ſort, all are not alike ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; of ſome we may ſay as <hi>Gregory</hi> doth, that they rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a <hi>Practiſer</hi> then an <hi>Interpreter;</hi> and of that Nature this ſeems to be.

            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt ſpake Parables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſaith St. Mark 4.2. <hi>He taught them many things by Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>

               <hi>Math.</hi> 13.1, 24, 31, 33, 44, 45, 47. And there was another (omitted by St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> but) recorded by St. <hi>Mark, Cap.</hi> 4.26. The Parable of the Tares which was at the ſame time delivered, and (as it juſtly is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) immediately after the Parable of the Sower, (and ſo was the ſecond in order).

            <p>The Reaſon why our Saviour uſed ſo frequently this kind of Teaching, may (in general) be this; There is no kind of ſpeech,<label type="milestone">

            <p>Were it unlawful for Miniſters to Illuſtrate their Doctrines by ſuch Allegorical and Parabolical expreſſions, we may well think that God would not have commanded his ſervants to have done it, as he did, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.2, 24, 3.

So St. <hi>Paul,</hi> preaching of the Reſurrection, illuſtrateth it by many natural Similitudes. What ſhall I ſay more? if we peruſe the writings of the antient Fathers (eſpecially <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) and of latter writers, we ſhall find that they make uſe of Parables very frequently, and to very good purpoſe.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115536:27"/>being full of wiſdome, and divine truth: Queſtionleſſe, the ſpirit of God would not have ſuffered the leaves of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to have bin fowled with ſo many Apologues, Riddles, Parables, Proverbs, Allegories, as are therein recorded; nor would our bleſſed Saviour, in whoſe mouth was never found any deceit or guile, have ſpoken ſo many, might they not lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profitably have bin uſed of us: but, in ſo doing he gives us to underſtanſt the liberty that his ſervants have, in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial function, not onely barely and nakedly to propound their Doctrines, but to uſe the help of Invention and Art, for the Illuſtration of them: Provided,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Majeſty of the Word be carefully preſerved, and that no occaſion be given to any, to think unreverently of ſo high a Myſterie, by propounding any baſe and ſordid ſtuffe, unto the Auditory, in a Parabolicall or ſimilitudinary way.

            <p>Secondly, Compariſons and Similitudes that are brought for Illuſtration of Doctrine, ſhould be fetcht from ſuch things as are moſt familiar, and beſt known unto our Hearers. When the Prophets had to deal with the <hi>Aegyptiaens,</hi>

This Compariſon ſo wrought upon that Marqueſſe, that through God's goodneſſe, and the gratious aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his bleſſed Spirit, from that very houre he reſolved with himſelf (as he told (many times) his friends) more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to reſtrain his Affections from following the vain delights and pleaſures of the world as before be had done; and to ſet his mind on thoſe things which made after true happineſſe, which accordingly he did.

            <p>But why is it reſembled to a Vineyard, rather than to another thing?</p>
            <p>It is compared to many other things in Scripture, beſides a Vineyard, as to a <hi>houſe,</hi> to an <hi>Orchard,</hi> to a <hi>Garden</hi> encloſed, to a <hi>Field</hi> in tillage, to a <hi>threſhing floor,</hi> &amp;c. But of all other reſemblances of earthly things none doth ſo fully expreſs, and ſet forth the nature and condition of the Church, as this of a Vineyard, which that it may appear the better, let us take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome particulars, wherein this ſpiritual Vineyard the Church doth hold reſemblance with the other.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:115536:33"/>
            <p>Firſt, A Vineyard, is a place, ſeperated and encloſed from other grounds. No Vineyard is naturally a Vineyard;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ. on</hi> Iſa. 5.1. <hi>Pag.</hi> 73. Levit. 20.24, 26. Numb. 23.9. Deut. 14.2.

            <p>Secondly, No Vineyard is in its perfect glory, ſo ſoon as it is taken in. Her plants being ſet, come not preſently to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and growth, but by degrees: So it is with the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. Divers Workmen and Labourers are ordained to be imployed about it, for the perfection of it,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.11, 12.</note> even after it is planted. The Apoſtles took great paines in planting Churches; but, had not Evangeliſts followed after, and watered what they had planted with a diligent hand, all had bin loſt: And for this purpoſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Creta,</hi> after he had planted the Church there, to redreſſe things that were defective, or to ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten things that were aptto grow crooked amongſt them,<note place="margin">Tit 1.5. <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> and to perfect his work. And hereto tends that prayer of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 5.10.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A Vineyard when it flouriſheth,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.10.</note> and is come to ſome perfection, is a place of great delight; both in reſpect of the <hi>pleaſant ſmell</hi> that it yieldeth, and <hi>comfortable ſhadow</hi> that it affordeth; So is the Church, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.6, 7. <hi>The ſmell of it is like unto a field that the Lord hath bleſſed.</hi>

And it affoards a <hi>Refrigerium,</hi> a comfortable ſhadow, and Arbour againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of heat, according to that, Iſa. 4.6. <hi>There ſhall be a Tabernacle for a ſhadow in the day time, from the heat; and for a place of Refuge, and for a covert from ſtorms and rain.</hi> The very enemies of the Church have found this to be true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Fourthly, To a Vineyard it may be compared in inſpect of the Fertility, or fruitfulneſſe thereof. It beares much fruit, and fruit of the beſt kind: A Vineyard is ſtored with divers plants (one plant maketh not a Vineyard); and thoſe plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s are loaden
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115536:34"/>with fruits, they bring forth in bunches and cluſters, and not a berry here, and another there, but the load is ſuch, that the branches bear, that it ſeems many times to exceed the ſtrength of the branch that bears them; The Church is fertile of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, there are <hi>multitudes of them that believe:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 4.32. &amp; 5, 14.</note> So fruitful is the Church of Children, as that ſhe wonders at her own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and ſaith, <hi>The place is too ſtraite for me; give place to me, that I may dwell:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 49.19, 20. Cap. 54.1. Rom. 15.14. Phil. 1.11. Acts 9.33. 2 Cor. 8.7.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath begotten me theſe, ſeeing I have loſt my Children and am left deſolate,</hi> Iſa. 49.19, 20, &amp; 54, 1. (which is to be underſtood of the calling of the Gentiles, after the caſting off of the Jews). And every member of the Church, every branch of the Vine is loaden with good f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uit, they <hi>abound in every thing</hi> in faith, in utterance, in knowledge, in the works of Charity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. and therein beyond their power they are willing of themſelves, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. they do all that ever they can do,<note place="margin">Luke 21.4.</note> and indeed many times more then they ſeem able to do, in the ſervice of God, and love to man, as did the poor widdow that caſt in all that ever ſhe had into the treaſury.</p>
            <p>And as a Vineyard is more fruitful then any other plantation, ſo it yieldeth the beſt fruit of any other. No fruit is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable to the taſte,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.13.</note> nor more comfortable to the heart, then that which comes from the Grape. Let the Vine it ſelf be heard ſpeaking in <hi>Jothams</hi> parable, <hi>My wine cheareth both God and Man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 26.29.</note> It is an high Hyperbole, yet ſeconded, by the God of truth, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.29. It muſt needs be an excellent Liquor (ſaith a Learned Divine) which is uſed to reſemble the joyes of Heaven. And what fruit can be compared with the fruit that a Chriſtian beats? all other fruit that grows without this fence, is but ſoure and bitter, ſeem it never ſo fair and glorious to the eye, yet it is but hedge fruit, or like unto the grapes of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and cluſters of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 30.32.</note> Deut. 32.32. <hi>Extra Eccleſiam nulla ſalus,</hi> without the Church no ſalvation is to be expected.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, A Vineyard is a well ordered place, there the Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks may be ſeen equally ſwelling, the Stakes pitched in a good height and diſtance, the Vines handſomely pruned, the ground cleanlily kept, and well howed, all things are well ordered in it. And ſo is it in the Church, inſomuch that <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelf could not but admire at it, and in a rapture cry out, <hi>How goodly are

               <hi>as the Vallies are they ſpread forth, as gardens by the Rivers ſide,</hi> &amp;c. Numb. 24.5, 6. as if he ſhould have ſaid, I ſee in this people (the Church of God) a moſt goodly order, in the pitching of their Tents according unto their Tribes, inſomuch that my ſenſes are therewith raviſhed, and I want words to expreſſe the glory and beauty of it; And in regard of this goodly order in it, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> compares it to <hi>an Army with Banners,</hi>

            <p>Sixthly, To a Vineyard the Church may be compared, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Imbecillity and weakneſſe of it. No poſſeſſion (ſaith <hi>Cato</hi>) requires more paines about it then a Vineyard doth; Corne comes up and growes alone of it ſelf, without the Husbandman's care, <hi>Inviſa vireſcunt gramina,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 4.17.</note> Mark 4.17. But the Vine is <hi>fragile lignum,</hi> a fraile kind of plant, it muſt be ſupported, ſheltered, daily dreſſed and attended, elſe it ſoon waxeth luxurious, and is in danger to grow wilde, after it once waxeth wanton: The Church is in it ſelf weak, compared to a woman, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.6.

            <p>Secondly, As the Church is a Vineyard in regard that it is not preſently brought to perfection upon the planting of it; then it may leſſon ſome that are of the Schiſmatical ſeparation; who, becauſe of ſome infirmities that are in a Church, will not own it to be a Church. Should we ſeparate for ſome defects and wants, to what particular viſible Church on Earth will we aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate our ſelves? Only the Church Triumphant in Heaven, is abſolutely perfect, and without blemiſh; Corruptions in any Church, call for <hi>a Reformation;</hi> but all corruptions do not warrant <hi>a Separation:</hi> Corruptions in mens man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do not; for albeit in private converſation we are to ſeparate from the ſociety of notorious Offenders, (except in caſes before excepted) yet a ſeparation from a particular viſible Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11.</note> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thereby warranted. The Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was a true Church, notwithſtanding their manifold diſorders: And the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> a true Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. Revel. 2.4. Cap. 2.13.14.15. Verſ. 20. Revel. 3.1. Verſ. 16.17.</note> notwithſtanding her decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: So was the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> notwithſtanding ſhe was ſeated in Sathans circuit, and peſtered with the Sect of <hi>Baala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> and <hi>Nicolaitans: Thyatyra</hi> a true Church, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her <hi>Jeſabellizing;</hi> So was <hi>Sardis,</hi> notwithſtanding her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure deadneſſe; And <hi>Laodicea,</hi> notwithſtanding her luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſſe, poverty, and nakedneſſe: All theſe Churches had their failings in point of manners, yet were they the Churches of Chriſt, and might not be ſeperated-from; for that God had not forſaken them. God indeed had threatened ſome of theſe, that if they would not repent and amend, he would unchurch them, and take his Candleſtick from among them; but till he put his threat into execution, and removed his Tabernacle and worſhip, they were to be acknowledged and reverenced as the true Churches of Chriſt: So ſuch corruptions may be in a Church as deſerve God ſhould forſake it, and for which God in his word hath threatened that he will forſake it; but before it appear that God hath indeed forſaken that Church (which doth not appear (but the contrary) ſo long as God continueth his word,<note place="margin">Levit. 26.11, 12. Pſal. 76.1, 2.</note> and doctrine of ſalvation to a people, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.11, 12, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1.2.) we may not forſake it.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:115536:36"/>
            <p>It is not then <hi>Corruption in manners,</hi> that warrants a ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a Church, it muſt be <hi>corruption in Doctrine.</hi> Nor do all Errors that a Church holds even in point of Doctrine, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us to ſeperate from it, but errors, great and weighty: ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler errors cut not off ſalvation, and therefore may not cauſe a ſeperation. For where ſalvation may be had from theſe Aſſemblies, ſeperation may not be made,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.15. John 6.68. Gal. 1.2.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> 6.68. Nor may all errors weighty, even in the ſubſtance of Doctrine or Foundation, cauſe a ſeperation, for they may be held of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and through infirmity, but if they be obſtinately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and willfully perſiſted in, then with a good conſcience we may (nay muſt) ſeperate from ſuch a Church, as doth ſo maintain them,<note place="margin">Act. 19.9.</note> 
               <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9. And upon this ground have we ſeperated from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for whilſt ſhe onely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught her damnable Doctrines, and preſt them not upon us, as matters of faith, to be believed on ſalvation, but came with, <hi>It may be;</hi> our Fathers forſook her not, but ſought her cure. But when ſhe would not be cured, but perſiſted in her damnable errors, bringing them into Canon, preſſing them upon the conſcience with <hi>It muſt be,</hi> as Articles of Faith <hi>de jure</hi> to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, believed, and practiſed; Anathematizing us if we did not ſo, Excommunicating us for not doing ſo, giving us no room amongſt them but the fire: So forward were they to burn He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, that they counted it Hereſie not to ſtay to be burnt (as one ſpeaks). Indeed we went from them upon God's call<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not upon their driving; but, had we upon that account left them, they had little cauſe to chide us for leaving of them. To conclude (then) this branch of my Admonition; If any of you be enclined to ſeperate from the Church which hath begotten you, born you in her womb and arms, nurſed you at her breaſts; and wherein God hath ſealed you up to himſelf in Baptiſm, Examine well what errors thoſe are that are in her, and of what nature they are, before you ſeperate: good conſideration muſt be had that they be fundamental, and maintained with obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and then, what well-grounded aſſurance you have, that thoſe errors are repaired, and no other as great as thoſe, admitted in that other Church to which you joyn your ſelves: Errors there will be in all Churches, and to think to find a Church without

The other Perfection is of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and this is either <hi>Partial</hi> or <hi>Gradual;</hi> of Parts, or Degrees: the former is when the Image of God is ſo repaired in us, as that no part is wanting in the new man; every part and power of the ſoul is renewed and formed: As the Childe hath all the parts of the Father, when it is firſt born, and brought into the World, this is haveable. The other is, when there is not onely all kinds of graces, but that fulneſſe and perfection in them, as may ſuite with the ſtate of grace, in this life, and ſo farr as man is thereof capable during his earthly condition.

            <p>Fourthly, The Church is a Vineyard in reſpect of its Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, bearing much fruit, and beſt fruit: This calls upon us to be fruitfull, and that in the beſt kind: Chriſtianity is no barren Profeſſion, it will be doing. What <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of the nature of the Vine, that rather then her life ſhe will be alwaies bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plin.</hi> lib. 17. c. 22.</note> the ſame may be ſaid of every good Chriſtian, He is never well but when he is doing good; It is the delight, and joy of his Soul, to be <hi>rich in good works,</hi> and full of <hi>good fruits;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.8. Gal. 5.</note> to ſee his heart and life loaden with fruits of the beſt kind; as Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſſe, Goodneſſe, Faith, Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kneſſe, Temperance, and ſuch like fruits of the Spirit: Of which fruitfullneſſe, we ſhall ſpeak ſhortly more fully.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As the Church is reſembled to a Vineyard in reſpect of the Order that is in it; ſo it calls upon us who profeſſe our ſelves Members thereof, to walk orderly. The want of this the Apoſtle ſharply reproves in Profeſſors, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14.<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 5.14. 2 Theſ. 3.6, 11. Mat. 20.6.</note> and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6, 11. And ſuch are they</p>
            <p>Firſt, Who live without a Calling, and have no ſpecial ſetled courſe of life, wherein they may employ their Gifts, and Time, for their own and the Churches good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such as are diſſolute and negligent in their Vocations, and Callings: theſe the Apoſtle terms <hi>diſorderly Walkers,</hi> and addreſſeth his ſpeech eſpecially unto,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.7, 11.</note> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.7, 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Such as intrude upon other mens Callings; theſe break their Ranks, and diſorder all:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.20, 24.</note> 
               <hi>Let every one abide in that Calling whereunto he is called.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20, 24.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Such as trangreſſe Ordinances, and Rules, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the ordering of life and converſation, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10.<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3.10.</note> The Scripture giveth Rules of Direction how to carry our ſelves in every ſtation, and hath promiſed much peace and comfort to

               <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Agur</hi> tells us of <hi>three things that go well, yea four that are comely in going. A Lyon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 30.29, 30, 31.</note>

Theſe patterns of comely going are propounded to this intent, that every one in his P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace, and Calling, ſhould have a ſpecial regard of orderly walking. When Magiſtrates know how to rule well, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to obey; Miniſters to teach, and People to learn; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Families to command, and Inferiours to obſerve their Precepts: there will a comlineſſe and beauty appear in the face of Church and State; but before, it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The world looks upon Miniſters onely,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. Ult.</note> as <hi>Men in orders,</hi> at leaſt ſuch as ought to be ſo. But it concerns you, as well as them, to walk orderly, if you expect Salva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, In reſpect of the Churches Imbecillity, and Feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is like unto a Vineyard; It cannot ſupport it ſelf. And ſo it teacheth us not to truſt to our own ſtrength, but take hold on the ſtrength of God, as we are willed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.6.

Oh take heed of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on your own ſtrength:<note place="margin">Phi. 4.13.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> did ſo but a little, and you know how dangerouſly he fell. Bring the <hi>Key</hi> with you, wind your ſelves about the Prop that muſt uphold you: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>strong in God,</hi>

               <hi>and in the power of his Might,</hi> and fear not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Whereas the Church is a Vincyard in reſpect of Danger: Let all be ſtirred up in general to ſeek the ſafety and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115536:39"/>welfare of it, by our prayers and pious endeavours:<note place="margin">Lament. 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you, all ye that paſſe by? Behold, and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow, which is done unto me:</hi> Such is the Churches complaint at this day, and yet the ruines and breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Zion</hi> we behold with a regardleſſe eye; wee look to our private wealth, and particular eſtates;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11.11. Neh. 1.4, 5. Dan. 10.2, 3.</note> and if it go well with us (as we think), we regard not much, how it goes with the Church of God: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> did not thus; <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not ſo; <hi>Daniel</hi> did not ſo; Theſe grieved, mourned, faſted, prayed, under the preſſures of the Church, albeit they themſelvs, for their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal concernments, were in peace. Queſtionleſs, there is no one Sin, for which God hath more a controverſy with this Land, then this, That the Wants, and Maimes, and Breaches of his Vineyard are looked on with a regardleſſe eye, and ſo little laid to heart: <hi>I looked and there was none to help,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 63.5.6.</note> 
               <hi>and I wondered that there was none to uphold, Iſa.</hi> 63.5, 6. Can we think our ſelvs lively Members of the Church, Branches of the true Vine, or that we have the Affections of God's Children in us, when we ſee the Vineyard of the Lord ſuſtain loſſe, and be in hazard of waſte without any remorſe? Let Magiſtrates uſe the power of the Sword; Miniſters, of the Word; All, one the other,<note place="margin">Lament. 5.21.</note> aſſiſt by their prayers, <hi>Turn thou us to thee, O Lord, and we ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: renew our daies as of old. Even ſo be it Lord, ſo be it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly, from the Dangers that God's Vineyard is liable continually unto; Every one within the Church, Prants of this Vineyard, may be warned to expect tryals, and prepare for them. <hi>In the World</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you ſhall have tribulation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.33.</note> or bruiſings (for ſo the word is, <hi>John</hi> 16.33.); Grievances, brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, preſſures, expect, and look for: Ye are goodly branches of the true Vine (ſaith <hi>Cyprian</hi>),<note place="margin">Cyp. ad Marcel.</note> hanged with Cluſters of ripe Grapes; Secular perſecution is your treading, and preſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Your Wine-preſs is the priſon; and inſtead of Wine, your blood is drawn from you: The faireſt Grapes are preſſed, that they may yield the ſweeteſt juyce. This World is not a Paradiſe, but a Purgatory, to the Godly. <hi>Ye have not yet reſist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Blood,</hi> many of our Breth en have,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.4.</note> and who knowes what we may do?</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:115536:40"/>
            <p>Eighthly, In that, as in a Vineyard ſo in the Church, all in it are not of it; Let us not content our ſelves with this, that we live within the pale, and are accounted members of the viſible Church, that we have bin baptized, and ſo externally and ſacramentally engrafted into the body of Chriſt; for there are two ſorts of branches in the Vine as appears,<note place="margin">John 15.2.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> 15.2. Some that would willingly be eſteemed ſo, and are eſteemed ſo to be, by reaſon of their outward Profeſſion, and external engrafting into him, but they do not take; they bring forth no fruit; and theſe kind of branches ſoon dye, and admit of <hi>a cutting off,</hi> not having the ſap of grace miniſtered unto them from the ſtock. Others, are bearing-branches, ſuch as are both externally, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally engrafted into Chriſt, and receive ſap from him, and bring forth fruit in him: Theſe ſhall live and abide for ever. And unleſſe thou beeſt ſuch a branch, engraf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed into Chriſt, by a true and lively faith, and made one with him, as the Branch is with the Vine, Thou wilt periſh eternally, for all thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſion: How theſe may be known from the other, we ſhall ſhew you afterwards.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If the Church be as a Vineyard, deſpicable when it hath left bearing; Oh! then look unto your ſelves, that you caſt not your leaves and become barren; Indeed there is no Vine but hath a Winter ſeaſon, but ſtill the ſap remaines in the Root; and after it is cut, and hath bled, it recovers it ſelf again, and brings forth abundantly as before; In caſe it do not, it is good for nothing but for the fire, as God ſhews <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in that Parable,<note place="margin">Ezek. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. Haſt thou then bin forward, and fruitful in works of piety, mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now haſt given over bearing? make uſe of God's corrections, bleed for thy provocations, and recover thoſe things that are ready to dye in thee, for fear burning be thy end: And ſo much of the Uſes which we may make of the <hi>Allegory</hi> in general, in that the Church is reſembled to a Vineyard. Now ſomething, of the <hi>Unity</hi> of it, and Gods <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> and Intereſt therein, would be ſaid.</p>

               <hi>Livy</hi> tells us a Story, That when the Common wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was in great danger,<note place="margin">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed the people. And I could wiſh it might prevail with us: For as the health and ſafety of the Body depends upon the concord of the Parts, in the mutuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their dutyes; ſo doth the well fare of the Church, when we ſhew out ſelves to be Members one of another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is <hi>one Spirit</hi> which we are all partakers of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. As in the naturall body there are not divers Souls,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.

Hear what St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith of ſuch, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>They are ſenſuall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 19.</note> 
               <hi>and have not the Spirit:</hi> We need not load them with any other guilt than that. <hi>Are you not carnall</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the contentious Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3.)? Yes you are,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.3. Rom. 8.6.</note> and void of the Spirit; and <hi>to be carnally minded is death, Rom.</hi> 8.6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>One hope of our Calling;</hi> that is, we are called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one and and the ſame Inheritance, which we all hope for, where we ſhall live ſweetly and bleſſedly together; <hi>Fall not out</hi> therefore <hi>by the way</hi> (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his Brethren). It is ſhame,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.24.</note> and pity, to ſee diſcord, and contention, between them that muſt forever live together in peace and love: Indeed it is a ſad ſight to behold two Heirs, to be at daggers drawing,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115536:43"/>when the Inheritance cannot, nor ſhall be divided.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>One Lord,</hi> which is our head Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe Cogniſance and Livery, is Love and Unity, <hi>John</hi> 13.35.<note place="margin">Joh. 13.35.</note> This Cogniſance was ſo apparent in the Livery of Chriſtians, who lived in the Primitive times, that the very Heathen knew a Chriſtian by it: <hi>See</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>how they love one another.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertull.</note> And ſee, ſaid the Chriſtians of them, How they bate one another. Is it not a great diſhonour to our Lord, and Maſter, that we caſt off this Livery, ſo that now the very Heathen may ſay of us, as then Chriſtians ſaid of them, See what differences, what diſcords, are amongſt them? Had we many Lords to ſerve, no wonder if we differed, (for <hi>no man can ſerve two Maſters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6.24. Zeph. 3.9.</note> much leſſe many): but ſeeing we have but one Lord to obey, let us put <hi>one ſhoulder</hi> to his work.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>One Faith,</hi> which is the Soul of our Souls. One, whether we underſtand it of the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, (called, in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Confeſſion, the Catholique Faith of all Chriſtians); or, of the <hi>Gift of Faith,</hi> whereby we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to Juſtification; which Grace is but one and the ſame, in all the Elect, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.1. Tit. 1.4.</note> and therefore called the <hi>common Faith, Tit.</hi> 1.4. for that all Beleivers do, by one and the ſame Faith, believe in one and the ſame Chriſt: As there is but one Church in the Faith, ſo but one Faith in the Church; <hi>Una fides ſpecie, non una numero,</hi> One Faith in nature, not one in number; One, <hi>ratione Objecti,</hi> which is Chriſt, not one <hi>ratione Subjecti;</hi> For every Believer hath his own Faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4.<note place="margin">Hab. 2.4. Mar. 5.34.</note> And ſo there are as many Faiths as there are Beleivers: We may ſay of Faiths as of Faces, <hi>Facies non omnibus una, Non diverſa tamen;</hi> One Light, many Raies; one Fountain, many Streams: This Faith being but one, we ſhould therefore ſtudy to keep the unity of it, in the bond of Love; and ſo compoſe our Affections as that we may go out with one heart, and one mind, in the profeſſion of it: <hi>We can do nothing</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>againſt the truth but for the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.8.</note> So long as there is found agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in fundamental truths betwixt us, and diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it ſhall be our wiſdom to ſilence our diſputes, and leave off wranglings about matters meerly notionall, and curious. But if in caſe this One Faith, <hi>which was once</hi> (for all) <hi>given to

The ſignification of both which, were taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in thoſe times, that they might learn to put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Baptiſm by the Miniſter (which an Hypocrite may have); and the Inward Baptiſm by the Spirit, which Chriſt beſtoweth on his own Elect: And that they might be inſtructed in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sacrament, and the ſignification thereof; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (it might be) of the Baptiſm of ſuffering affliction for the Goſpel, whereunto the Sacrament of Baptiſm obligeth.

            <p>It was no ordinary nor trivial Tree, but of a noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kind (called upon by other Trees to be King over them) and brought forth ſweet and delicious fruit,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.10.</note> 
               <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.10. By which <hi>Figg-Tree</hi> the Jewiſh Synagogue is eſpecially meant, and to them in a more ſtrict ſenſe it is to be applyed, but <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ratione,</hi> in a general conſideration, every Chriſtian Congregation,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115536:49"/>yea, every individuall perſon of ſuch a Congregation is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being concerned there in.</p>
            <p>Why a Figg-tree ſhould be mentioned, rather then any other Tree, ſome Reaſons may be rendred, as this in generall; The Figg-tree was very common in <hi>Judea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mald. in loc.</note> and frequently planted in their Vineyards, for that the Vine delighteth much in its neighbourhood and ſhade; and thence is it that we ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find them joyned together in the Scripture, <hi>Dent.</hi> 8.8. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.33. <hi>Joel.</hi> 1.7. &amp; 2.22. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.9. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <p>More particularly, <hi>In reference to the Synagague of the</hi> Jews, and that State; The Figg-tree, above other Trees, did beſt ſet forth their condition. The Figg-tree is a <hi>ſucculent Plant</hi> full of leavs and luxuriant Branches; ſo did that Nation come out,<note place="margin">Rarrard. in loc.</note> and ſpend its ſapp in outward Obſervations and Ceremonies, contenting it ſelf with the fair leavs of outward profeſſion, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Again, The Figg-tree is the <hi>firſt that buddeth,</hi> but the laſt whoſe fruit is ripe; The Jews budded long before the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.25, 26.</note> (and it is to be prayed for, that the time of their ripe fruit may be haſtned); but the fullneſſe of the Gentiles muſt come in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ripening can be expected, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26.

                  <hi>Parr</hi> his Comment on Rom. 11.15.</note> and in reſpect of Grace (which laſt emptineſſe is a very great impediment to the calling of the Jews): but when fulneſſe of the one, ſhall be come in, and the number of converted Gentiles made up (which aſſuredly ſhall be), then ſhall follow a generall converſion of the other; the whole body of the Jews in geneaall, (albeit nor every ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſingular perſon) ſhall be received to grace and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is a Myſtery, and of us not ſufficiently underſtood: how and when theſe things ſhall be, God only knows (ſaith <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi>) let that ſatisfy; onely let all further their ripening, by earneſt prayers and ſpeedy repentance, for thoſe Sins which have been hitherto Barrs and Obſtacles to hinder it.</p>

            <p>In Reference <hi>to the Chriſtian Church,</hi> under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Figg tree is named in reſpect of ſundry properties, wherein it doth hold reſemblance.</p>

Rev. 2. &amp; 3.</note> It is his Ordinance that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Congregation aſſembleth, prayer ſhould be uſed; It is his Ordinance that his Word ſhould be publiquely Read: It is his Ordinance that his Word ſhould be opened, and applyed in our publique Aſſemblies; It is his Ordinance that in our publiquely Aſſemblies, Pſalms ſhould be ſung; It is his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance that the Sacraments ſhould be adminiſtred, and that in the publique Aſſembly; And it is his Ordinance that the Miniſter ſhould diſmiſſe the Congregation with a bleſſing, as Scripture doth evidence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All <hi>Corruptions</hi> that are in a Church do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church her; The <hi>Ten Tribes,</hi> after their defection, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their groſſe Corruptions and Idolatry, yet becauſe they profeſſed by circumciſion, and other wayes the true <hi>Jehovah,</hi> they remained ſtill a true Church, (though a very impure and imperfect Church,) and were ſtill called the <hi>People of God,</hi> the <hi>Beloved of God,</hi> the <hi>Children of the Living God.</hi> So the ſtate of the Jews was wonderfully corrupt in Chriſt's time, and yet ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation even at that time was from them, and they the true Church of God: the like might be ſhewed of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> Great corruptions were to be found in them, and yet they were ſtill the true Churches of Chriſt, (as we ſhewed you before, when we ſpake of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Vineyard.)</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Thoſe may be eſteemed Corruptions in a Church which are none at all. It is no corruption in the preaching of the word, to make uſe of the writings of men, ſo long as God's Word is made the Ground of all, the Touch-ſtone of all, and the Judge to determine of all truth: Had this been ſo, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets themſelvs had corrupted the Word, in alledging the ſayings of others, (yea, of Heathen Writers):<note place="margin">Dan. 4. &amp; 6. Ezra 1. Act. 17.18. 1 Cor. 15.33. Tit. 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>Daniel</hi> recited the Decree of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> and the Decree of <hi>Darius,</hi> and the Edict of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> alledged the Sentences of Heathen Poets; as of <hi>Aratus,</hi> and of <hi>Menander,</hi> and of <hi>Epimenides:</hi> St. <hi>Jude</hi> alledgeth the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy of <hi>Enoch,</hi> (which both <hi>Auguſtine</hi> &amp; <hi>Jerome,</hi> with others of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115536:59"/>our latter Writers, conceive to be Apocryphal). Whilſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning is made a Handmaid, to wait upon Lady Truth; it is no diſhonour, but rather an honour to her.</p>
            <p>Nor is it a corrupting of God's worſhip, to uſe ſtinted and ſett forms of Prayer in his ſervice. It is evident enough in Scripture, that the Church hath uſed, and might uſe them, in God's worſhip: In bleſſing the people it was enjoyned, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.23, 24. ſo at the ſetting forward of the Ark,<note place="margin">Numb. 6.23, 24.

               <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.35. and at the reſting of it <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. Many of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms were committed to the Church-Muſitians to be ſung, not onely as Meditations and Doctrines, for the Inſtruction of the Church, but as Prayers unto God; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. was penned for the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. a Prayer for the diſtreſſed. It is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that St. <hi>John</hi> taught his Diſciples a ſett-From,<note place="margin">Luke 11.1.</note> 
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.1. and thereupon our Saviour preſcribed to his Diſciples a form of Prayer, not only to be to them, and the whole Church, a <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Sampler,</hi> according to which, all our prayers ſhould be framed (as appears, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.9.) but even for them to ſay, uſing the very words as appears, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.2. And it is evident that our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, prayed the ſame paayer, and uſed the ſame words in prayer, more than Once, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.42. <hi>He uſed the ſame words</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt), nor were they ever the worſe for being often uſed. As for that which is objected, Of ſtinting the Spirit, and pinnioning the wings of the Dove; How is it more a tying of the Spirit up, than it is (to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer) when the Speaker prayes his conceived prayers? for to the Hearer that Prayer is a ſtinted Prayer, and as a ſett form to him; he muſt keep his mind intent to what is ſaid by him that prayes. Secondly, Although there are a tye of words, yet there is not a tye and reſtraint of the Spirit; for the heart may be enlarged therein, and the largeneſſe of the heart ſtands not ſo much in the variety of expreſſion,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Preſt:</hi> Saints daily exerciſe. p. <hi>82.</hi>
               </note> as in the extent of the Affection; But the newneſſe of his opinion, ſaith a Reverend Divine, is enough to diſcover the falſhood of it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, For that Diſcipline which they charge this Church of ours to be wanting in, and thence inferre that we are a falſe Church; It may be anſwered that we are not altogether without it, albeit we want that Diſcipline which they pretend. 2ly,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115536:59"/>It is an error to make Diſcipline ſo eſſential a property of the Church, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s that that which is without it, is no true, but a falſe Church. That it is neceſſary for the beauty and <hi>well being</hi> of the Church, we willingly grant; but that it is ſo eſſentially and imſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perably neceſſary to the truth and <hi>being</hi> of the Church; cannot be proved by evidence of Scripture. Is a houſhold having true matter and forme, and eſſential properties; a falſe houſhould, becauſe Government is wanting? or for that they in the Family have not that care as they ought to have one for anothers well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare? or becauſe there is not a Broom in it to ridd out the duſt? So in this caſe, the utmoſt that can be made of it, is, that ſuch a Church is a <hi>defective Church,</hi> a maimed Church (by which it is alſo corrupt, and may without great care ſuddenly come to ruine): but that this defect can make it either no <hi>Church,</hi> or a <hi>falſe Church,</hi> cannot be maintained. In a word then, this know;</p>
            <p>That the profeſſion of Chriſt in the right uſe of thoſe ſacred Ordinances, which the Lord hath ordained and inſtituted, to be parts of his worſhip (as Preaching of the word, adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, and Prayer) is that which doth conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a true viſible Church; and differenceth it from all other ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties: It is no <hi>viſible Church,</hi> that is without theſe; and that is a <hi>true viſible Church</hi> that hath theſe. And theſe I ſuppoſe none of you but are convinced in your conſcience to be found in this your Mother Church of <hi>England.</hi> Theſe we have, and in having of them, we are the true Church of Chriſt, having Him for our Head; Miniſters and People, for the body of it: and that our ſtanding in this Church is warrantable, ſafe and good.

            </p>
            <p>And by this you may perceive how ſevere a ſentence it is, to be juſtly caſt out of the Church; Other ſentences reach unto our Bodies, Goods, or Liberties, this to the Soul; by other ſentences we are committed to the Jayle, but by this to Sathan; which is worſe then to be clapt up in the vileſt Dungeon: for although it damne not a man, yet it damms up that man's way by ſhutting him out of that Church, through which he muſt go to Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being ſo great a danger, let every one take heed of falling into thoſe ſins that may draw on him this cenſure; for however it be lightly and ſlightly ſet by,<note place="margin">Math. 18.18, 19, 20.</note> yet that ſentence that is juſtly pronounced on Earth, is ratified and confirmed in Heaven, if Scripture may be believed, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.18, 19, 20.</p>

            <p>Where God hath planted a Church or People, there will he come and viſit that Church and People in a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This may be gathered from that anſwer which the true Church gives to forraign Congregations, who demanded of her, Where her beloved was, that they might ſeek him with her? <hi>My Beloved is gone down into the Garden,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, He viſits inwardly, <hi>Inſpirando,</hi> by the inſpiration of his holy Spirit, putting into our hearts holy thoughts, good deſires, and motions. He comes thus to us at one time or other; ſo he came to viſit hard-hearted <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 9.27. and to <hi>Balaam,</hi>

               </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of a greater power working in them, and by them, as that they had nothing to object againſt it; And this is the onely way you have to out-Preach us: And without this, all your Figg-leaves will not hide your ſhame, nor will they be able were they as bigg as Targets (as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith the leaves of the <hi>Indian</hi> Figg-Tree are,) to bear off that ſhowre of wrath which ſhall one day fall upon the heads of all barren and fruitleſs Profeſſors:</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Others there are, that bring forth fruit as well as buds and leaves, and yet their fruit ſhall not be accepted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For that it not <hi>naturall and kindly</hi> fruit, but degenerate; In the Creation every ſeed and plant brought fruit <hi>after its kind</hi> ſo it is in the Regeneration,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.12. Phil. 1.27, &amp; 3.20. Rom. 16.2. Epheſ. 5.3. Gal. 5.19.</note> good Trees bring forth fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Stock wherein they are engrafted, and the ſap they thence receive, and the Profeſſion that they make; but theſe men <hi>walk after the luſts of the Gentiles,</hi> and bring forth the <hi>fruits of the fleſh,</hi> (ſuch as thoſe mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19.) no manner of way anſwering to the ſeed that hath bin ſowen in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115536:67"/>them by the Miniſtery of the Word, which they have heard, and the doctrine which they have bin taught.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Say it be fruit of a better kind, yet it is <hi>not ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> fruit; It may be that they are ten or twenty years in Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſo long before they come to any good Reſolution, to leave their vitious wayes and courſes; and then they truſt to lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſprings and ſhowrs for the perfecting and ripening of it, and ſo neglecting the due ſeaſon of fruit, it happens that, with <hi>Eſau,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.16, 17.</note> they find <hi>no place for Repentance, though they ſeek it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Their fruit is <hi>not ſound</hi> fruit, but rotten at the coare, (however it be goodly and fair to look upon) like thoſe Apple Trees in <hi>Aſſyria</hi> (of which <hi>Solinus</hi> writes) the fruit whereof is as yellow as Gold, but being toucht is rotten, or like the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Sodom,</hi> beautiful to the eye; but being touched they fall to Cindars: zealous they ſeem outwardly, when they are cold at heart, or elſe lukewarm: Their aimes and ends in all their devotions is <hi>Self,</hi> like that <hi>Cardinal Wolſey,</hi> who layd a fair Foundation for a good Work, but his <hi>Ego et Rex meus</hi> marr'd all the Structure: he ſought to raiſe his own honour and reputation by the Ruine of his Soveraign's dignity. Such was the fruit the Phariſees of old bare:<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> and ſuch is the fruit of Papiſts at this day, who ſeek themſelves, in thinking to merit by their good works at the hands of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, their fruit is <hi>not fair,</hi> it is ſhrivelled up, either in ſome few duties of the firſt Table, as Hearing, Reading, Praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the duties of the ſecond Table they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tardy,<note place="margin">Iſa. 58 3, 5, 6.

               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3, 5, 6. So the Phariſees made long prayers, and under that pretence <hi>devoured up Widdows houſes,</hi> Math. 23.14. and ſuch is the fruit of all Hypocrites. Or elſe they are obſervant in the duties of the ſecond Table, with neglect of of the firſt,<note place="margin">Math. 23.23.</note> as, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.23. and ſuch is the fruit of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilian, and moral man.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Their fruit is <hi>not laſting:</hi> it holds good for the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeaſon of proſperity, but when the Winter of Adverſity and Perſecution comes,<note place="margin">Luke 8.13.</note> it ſayles, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. And ſuch is the fruit of the Temporary Believer, and Time-ſerving Chriſtian; his fruit laſts not all the year, not during term of Life, when as a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:115536:67"/>good Figg-Tree is never without ſome Figgs, hanging on the tender boughes, Winter nor Summer: A good Chriſtian like the Palm Tree ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12.<note place="margin">Pſ. 92.12.</note> grows <hi>fat and flouriſhing even in old age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let theſe and all ſuch other, be adviſed not to flatter themſelvs nor ſuffer themſelvs by vain pretences to be undone. It is not a fair bloſſome, a green leaf, nor Fruit of outward Profeſſion, externall reformation, common illumination, or any of the like Nature, that will ſatisfy God's expectation: he looks for fruit, and good fruit too, from every Figg-Tree, and at your hands he will require it.</p>

            <p>As <hi>Subſtance,</hi> ſo <hi>Circumſtance</hi> muſt be reſpected in the fruit we beat: and that, 1. Of Perſon, or Calling. 2. Of Time. 3. Of Place.</p>
            <p>It muſt be <hi>Our own Fruit,</hi> Pſal. 1.3. Beſides the fruit which is of a <hi>General kind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.3.</note> and grows upon every Tree of God's plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and upon every Branch that is grafted in the true Vine (as Love, Joy, Peace, and the reſt, mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22.) there is a more <hi>ſpeciall</hi> and <hi>particular Fruit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 9.10.</note> which every Tree muſt bring forth according <hi>to its kind.</hi> As the Olive Tree hath its fatneſſe; the Figg Tree, his ſweetneſſe; The Vine, his Wine, that cheareth God and man: So every Chriſtian hath his proper fruit, whereby he muſt be known in that Calling, wherein God hath ſet him. A King (ſaith <hi>Austin</hi>) ſerveth God after one ſort as he is a man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> Epiſt. 50.</note> after another ſort as he is a King: As he is a Man, he ſerveth him by living faithfully; as he is a King, by making Lawes for the keeping of his Subjects in peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. And ſo it may be ſaid of God's whole Houſhold, and Family; each one oweth a ſervice to God, after one ſort, in the <hi>generall fruit of holyneſſe;</hi> and after another in the <hi>proper fruits of our particular Callings</hi> and Stations: Whence it is, that that may be good in one, that is not in another; as appears by two remarkable Inſtances.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.6.

            <p>The other Inſtance is in King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> who went into the Temple to burn Incenſe upon the Altar of Incenſe;<note place="margin">2 Chro. 26.16.</note> This was not his Fruit, it appertained not to him to do it, but to the Prieſts, the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> (as <hi>Azariah</hi> told him,<note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.18.) and therefore it made not for his honour, for he was immediately ſtruck with Leproſy, which appeared in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to his ſhame,<note place="margin">Ver. 19.20.</note> inſomuch that he was thereupon thruſt out of the Temple for a Leper. It is not enough (then) that our works are ſuch as beſeem Repentance in the general; but they muſt be ſuch as have a due reſpect unto the performance of thoſe things which we are called unto in our Repentance,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.16, 17.

            <p>As it muſt be proper fruit, ſo it muſt be <hi>ſeaſonable.</hi> It is ſaid of the godly man, that <hi>he bringeth forth his fruit in his ſeaſon,</hi>

            <p>Nor may the <hi>Place</hi> be altogether neglected; For (as King <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorick</hi> ſpeaketh in <hi>Caſſiodore</hi>),<note place="margin">Aptum eſt omne bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:115536:69"/>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Quantity of it,</hi> our Fruit muſt <hi>be full;</hi> the want of this was objected to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. And St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s prayer on the <hi>Philippians</hi> behalf was, that they might <hi>be filled with the fruits of Righteouſneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1.11.</note> Phil. 1.11. Now our fruits may be ſaid to be full, when (like that Tree of Life men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,<note place="margin">Rev. 22.2. Cant. 7.13.</note> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.2.) we bear <hi>twelve manner of Fruits,</hi> and (as we read in <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.13.) <hi>all kind of ſweet Fruits, old an new:</hi> when we manifeſt in our lives every grace of the Spirit, as well as any, and make conſcience of every Chriſtian duty, as well as of any; when every member of the Body, power and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoul,<note place="margin">Jam. 3.17.</note> is laden with Fruit, no branch empty, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When our Fruits are <hi>anſwerable to the means,</hi> and coſt beſtowed on us. The want of this was blamed in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5.12.</note>

            </p>
            <p>And thus much of the firſt Patricular I propounded. Now to the ſecond; the <hi>Meanes</hi> that muſt be uſed, that the Fruit we bear may be thus Qualified: and ſo;</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Get to be engrafted into a lively ſtock,</hi> that is, into Chriſt; He is the Noble Stock into which all the Plants of Paradiſe muſt be ſet and engrafted,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.4. Coloſ. 2.7. Joh. 15.4. Numb. 17.8. Luke 23.39,—43.</note> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>without him we can do nothing,</hi> John 15.4. but being once ſet in Him, were we as dry as <hi>Aarons</hi> withered Rod, we ſhall preſently be charged into a flouriſhing and fruitful Tree, as was the Thief converted on the Croſſe <hi>Luke</hi> 23.39,—43.

            <p>Secondly, Earneſtly <hi>beg the ſpirit of God</hi> whereby the ſap may be conveyed from the Root,<note place="margin">Rom 8.9. Eph. 2.22. Rom. 8.11. Eph 3.16. 1 Theſ. 5.23.</note> into every branch; without it, we can have no communion with Chrſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.22. by it we ſhall be quickened, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. and ſtrenghened to <hi>every good work and action,</hi> Ephe. 3.16. Sanctified through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <hi>in body, in ſoul, and in ſpirit,</hi> 1. Theſ. 5.23. <hi>If the Clouds
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115536:69"/>be full, they will powre forth Rain upon the Earth,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 11.3.): So it a man be thus enriched with the ſpirit of grace, he cannot but be fruitful.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.3.</note> For as Chriſt and his Spirit are not ſundred; ſo cannot the Spirit be ſundred from the fruits of the Spirit, which are thoſe mentioned, <hi>Love, Joy, Peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.23.</note> 
               <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. Now by fervent and faithful prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the Spirit may be obtained, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with careful and conſcionable hearing of the word,<note place="margin">Luke 11.13. Act. 10.44.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Look that there be <hi>ſtore of ſuckers</hi> and <hi>feeders</hi> about the Root, theſe are they (you know) that by ſpreading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this way and that way, gather ſtrength and nouriſhment to the Tree, and every branch thereof, whereby it becomes fruitful: Holy affections, Love, Joy, deſire, Fear, Grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are the feeders of the Soul, and ſhould draw nouriſhment unto it from every one of Gods Ordinances, from the Word Read or Preached, Sacraments adminiſtred, and from all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Adminiſtrations whether of Mercy or Judgment. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was aboundant this way, as appears in the whole Book of the Pſalms, eſpecially in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. where we may find in every verſe almoſt he catcheth hold on Mercies, Judgments,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Threatnings; as the Ivye catcheth hold with its claw on every twigg, to climb up to its ſtature.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Preſerve the Bark;</hi> let not that be peeled off from the Tree; It is threatned as a ſoare Judgment againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> that <hi>the Figg-Tree ſhould be barked</hi> with the teeth of noyſome Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that God would ſend into their Land to puniſh them, inſomuch that the boughes thereof ſhould be left white;<note place="margin">Joel 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>Joel</hi> 1.7. To be left white without bark, was an indication of a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy withering. That bough that lies open without bark (ſaith <hi>Gregory</hi> on that place) looks white, but periſheth. Thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is like the Bark of the Figg Tree; preſumptuous ſins are like thoſe Creatures, that peel off the bark, beware of them; for by them, the conſcience is waſted and conſumed as iron is by ruſt: We ſin too much through ignorance and infirmity, but when we ſin wilfully and preſumptuouſly againſt knowledge, and the light of conſcience, our boughes will ſoon wax white; How frequent is it to ſee men that loſe a good conſcience, with

                  </gap>
               </note> the Merchandiſe of Faith will ſoon ſuffer wrack: Our outward actions, (as well as affections) may have a colour of good (as white is of Innocency); but our bark being pilled, it is no good whiteneſſe, but an indication of a periſhing condition; without a good conſcience all our actions, yea our beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances are ſo far from goodneſſe and acceptance, that they are abominable and diſtaſteful unto God: our Affections and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actions may have a colour of good, but all is defiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> 
               <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. the conſcience being defiled, it defiles all it meddles with; Hence <hi>David</hi> prayed ſo earneſtly to be kept from this barking of his boughes by any ſuch ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. The like care had <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.13. Acts 23.1.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1.

            <p>Fifthly, Be frequent and <hi>aboundant in the exerciſes of morti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fication;</hi> Bare the Tree about the Root, caſt away all looſe earth; withdraw thy ſoul from all worldly ſtayes and comforts: when the world hath left us naked, and deſtitute of her vain ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, we ſhall then take faſter hold on Chriſt our Saviour, in whom <hi>the Fatherleſſe find mercy;</hi>

For this end, make good uſe of all Croſſes and Afflictions, let them cauſe thee to acknowledge thy ſins, and break thy heart in the ſight of God; beſeech him that thou being exerciſed under them maiſt at length bring forth <hi>the quiet fruit of Righteouſneſſe,</hi>

            <p>Sixthly and Laſtly, To all this, <hi>the Influence of Heaven muſt be added,</hi> elſe no Fruit can be expected (as before hath been
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115536:70"/>ſhewed) <hi>The Heavens must hear the Earth,</hi> Hoſ. 2.21.

As for thoſe who delight to live in the ſhade, and ſhelter their ſouls from the influence of Heaven, that withdraw their hearts from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and comforts of an effectual and painful Miniſtery, let not ſuch ever look to become fruitful: And ſo much of the ſecond Particular that I propounded to you; Now to the third and laſt, which is the <hi>Motives</hi> to ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r us up to the uſing of theſe meanes, that we may bring forth fruit ſo qualified as hath bin declared; and they are many.</p>
            <p>Some reſpect God, ſome his Goſpel, ſome Man, others the Creature.</p>
            <p>In <hi>regard of God,</hi> we ought to be fruitful. Firſt, for that he hath deſerved it. Secondly, he ſeeks for it. Thirdly, and when he finds it, he counts himſelf honoured and glorified by it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He hath deſerved Fruit from us, in that he hath <hi>bought us</hi> at a dear rate <hi>from our vain converſation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18. Luke 1.75. Tit. 2.14. Joh. 15.16.</note> to ſerve Him all our dayes <hi>in Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe,</hi> He hath choſen us to be <hi>a Peculiar People unto himſelf, zealous of good Works,</hi> and made choyce of us before others, that we ſhould be Fruitful, and that our Fruit ſhould <hi>abide</hi> and <hi>abound.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2.10.</note> He hath made us his own work nauſhip, by the effectual calling of grace, and <hi>created us to good works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to walk in them.</hi> He hath planted us,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.</note> hedged us about, manured us, watered us with the ſweet dews of his Word and Goſpel from Heaven; trimmed us with his pruning book of Judgments and Corrections: And <hi>what could he do more for us that he hath not done?</hi> And what can he expect leſſe from us, towards all his paines and travails with us then Fruit? <hi>He that ſowes, ſowes in hope</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle).<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.7.</note> God hath ſet in hope, planted in hope, watered in hope, of ſome anſwerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and ſhall it be denyed? or canſt thou imagine that God hath took all this paines with thee, and beſtowed all this coſt upon thee, that thou ſhouldſt bear green boughes, or gay bloſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115536:71"/>ſomes onely? Indeed leaves come of the ſeed, and chaff from the kernel: but doth any man plant for leaves, and ſow for chaff? you know it is fruit that they look for: Had it not bin for that, thou hadſt bin no Tree; Fruit was that, for which thou wert ſet, and haſt been thus long preſerved. As God (then) hath had his time of planting,<note place="margin">Pſ. 128.2.</note> ſo in equity and juſtice let him have his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and now at lengh <hi>eat of the labours of his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>He hath ſought it of us,</hi> as our Text ſpeaks. The Prophet <hi>Nahum</hi> tell us,<note place="margin">Nah. 3.12.</note> that the <hi>firſt ripe Figgs if they be ſhaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater,</hi> Nah. 3.12. Such rip Figgs we ought to be. The very ſignification of Gods will, ſhould be motive ſtrong enough to perſwade obedience,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.3.</note> albeit no other reaſon nor inducement appears: we ſhould <hi>offer</hi> and <hi>preſent our ſelves</hi> and fruits to him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.5. Rom. 12.1.</note> and not put him to the trouble to ſeek for his own; but when he doth come and ſeek to us for it (which he need not do) it is not ſafe for us to diſappoint him.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeking implyes divers things; Firſt, an earneſt deſire to find the thing ſought for, as, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.45<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such an earneſt deſire hath God to find Fruit on us,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.4. Mat. 13.45 Deut. 5.20, &amp; 32, 29. Pſal. 81.13. Hoſ. 6.4. Luk. 13.34, &amp; 19, 41, 42. Cant. 3.1.—5. Luk, 15.8. 2 Tim. 1.17. Mat. 23.37. Ver. 34.35.</note> whom he hath planted in his Church, as appears by thoſe pathetical ſpeeches which he uſeth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29, <hi>&amp;</hi> 32, 29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81, 13. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4. And in this Chapter, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.34, <hi>&amp;</hi> 19, 41, 42. By all which, and many ſuch like, it appears that He doth ſeek ſeriouſly, and fervently for fruit, and is much grieved when he is deceived in his expectation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Seeking imports diligence and frequency: It is no rare but a continued Act. So <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. Thus God comes and ſeeks for fruit, not once, nor twice, and then gives over, but he comes often; <hi>How often would I have gathered thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt), <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37. not <hi>once,</hi> but <hi>often,</hi> and that by the external miniſtry of the Prophets, ſent before him, <hi>ver.</hi> 34.35. and <hi>often</hi> in his own perſon, (as on the next verſe we ſhall hear more fully). And how often hath he come ſeeking fruit from us, by the miniſtry of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince his departing from us, whom he hath ſent unto us to receive your Fruits,<note place="margin">Cant. 8.11.

Let this prevail with us to bear fruit to God: It is a high honour that God doth put upon us, to eſteem himſelf honoured by any of us; he needs not our furtherance therein, yet he eſteems himſelf to be honoured by our fruits. We pray with our tongue, <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> let us endeavour it in our lives by bringing forth ſuch fruit as may make to his praiſe. And thus of the motives which reſpect God.</p>

               </note> and keep in mind Gods favours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us; when we highly prize them according to their goodneſſe, and put a right eſtimate upon them, ſtirring up our ſouls to thankfulneſſe (as <hi>David</hi> did) then <hi>Gratias Habemus,</hi> we have thanks in our hearts for God, or we have thankful hearts to God.

            </p>
            <p>When we confeſſe Gods goodneſſe, and with our lips ſet forth his praiſe; when we publiſh abroad the loving kindneſſe of the Lord, and tell our Children what God hath done for us, and provoke others to this duty, then <hi>Gratias agimus;</hi> we give thanks to God with our Tongues; <hi>Out of the aboundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we expreſſe a thankful heart in our lives, uſing theſe bleſſings which God hath beſtowed on us to the right end, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Gods gifts to the Giver's honour; when we lead a godly life, and <hi>order our converſation aright,</hi> and abound in good works, then <hi>Gratias referimus opere,</hi> we return thanks to the God of Heaven by our lives.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, that <hi>Gratitude</hi> is <hi>grateful</hi> and acceptable to God, whoſe <hi>Root</hi> is in the <hi>Heart, Bloſſomes</hi> in the <hi>Tongue,</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> in the <hi>Hand:</hi> whoſe <hi>Root</hi> is <hi>Faith, Bloſſomes Praiſes,</hi> and <hi>Fruit, Good Works.</hi> Bloſſoms in the lips may ſoon be blowen away with a breath,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.30, 31.</note> it is a fading thing; but when the heart and life is thankful, that pleaſeth God better <hi>then a Sacrifice that hath horne or hooffe,</hi> Pſal. 69.30, 31.</p>
            <p>But what if one be not able? We would pay God this Rent and Tribute of thanks,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
               </label> but we have not wherewith.</p>
            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:115536:86"/>
            <p>There are but few Tenants, ſo <hi>impudent</hi> (ſaith one) as to ſay, They will pay no Rent; Indeed,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reſp. </seg>
               </label> many pretend that they are ſo <hi>impotent</hi> that they cannot pay. To theſe, I give this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, God is no hard Landlord, he letteth out his Farm or Vineyard at ſuch a Rent, that the Farmer may live well upon it.<note place="margin">Cant. 8.11.</note> You read (<hi>Cant.</hi> 8.11.) that <hi>a thouſand pieces of ſilver</hi> were to be paid for Rent of the Vineyar, but yet <hi>two hundred pieces</hi> were allowed to them that kept the Fruit; (which was a great gain): So, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.33. they could pay, but would not.<note place="margin">Math. 21.33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Gratitude will be caſting about, and projecting what to return, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.8. <hi>He deviſeth,</hi> ſtudieth, meditareth how he ſhall compaſſe his Rent; how to pay it: So, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.17.<note place="margin">Iſa. 32.8. Pſal. 116.2.</note> The <hi>word of God</hi> will help thoſe that are inquiſitive, and give directions; and the <hi>Works of God</hi> will furniſh us. We read in the Goſpel of <hi>a Fiſh</hi> that brought money in the mouth to <hi>Peter,</hi> Math. 17.27. wherewith he payed Tribute.<note place="margin">Math. 17.27.</note> There is not a <hi>Fowl</hi> in the Heavens, a <hi>Fiſh</hi> in the Sea, a <hi>Beast</hi> on the Earth; not any <hi>worm</hi> that crawles upon the Earth, but brings ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the mouth of it, to help a thankful heart towards the payment of that Rent which is due to God; <hi>Perſius</hi> found it in a foal <hi>Toad,</hi> which when he ſaw, he wept, and being asked the reaſon why he wept, he anſwered, he bewailed his Ingratitude, who ſerved not the Lord as he ought, who had made him a Man; and not a Toad.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He is not alwayes unthankful who doth not <hi>Par Pari referre,</hi> recompence a benefit: but he would not, although he could. <hi>Furnius</hi> told <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (who had multiplyed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on him) that in one thing he had damnified him, yea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done him; You have done ſo much for me (ſaith he) that I muſt live and dye unthankful; that is, without ſhewing my thankfulneſſe, by equivalent recompences.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Where there is an endeavour and deſire to teſtifie the thankfulneſſe of our hearts, and to make requital in the beſt manner that we can; God accepts of it. We read that the <hi>Grecians</hi> in a great ſolemnity, did preſent to <hi>Philip of Macedon</hi> many goodly gifts; amongſt others, a <hi>Painter</hi> preſented him with his own Picture in a Table, ſet forth with many Pearls
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115536:87"/>and Jewels, artificially drawn, and over every Jewer was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Vellem &amp; hoc,</hi> I would I were able to give ſuch gifts as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe; So ſaith the Thankful heart; I would I could render more and better. To be thankful in affection, when there is no more in our Power, is true thankfulneſſe, which hath ever a care to profeſſe and perform, ſo far as it can.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Where other abilities are wanting, let us ſtill make our thankful acknowledgements I can never give to God ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent thanks, (ſaid the moral man); yet I will ever acknowledge that I cannot give Him thanks ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, And having nothing elſe to give, give him <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> as <hi>Aeſchines</hi> did to <hi>Socrates,</hi> who receiving great rewards from his Schollars for his reading to them; This <hi>Aeſchines</hi> being a poor Auditor of his, and having nothing elſe to give, told him <hi>Quod unum habeo, meipſum tibi dono,</hi> &amp;c. I beſtow my ſelf upon thee, having nothing elſe to give thee; this <hi>Socrates</hi> took ſo kindly, that he anſwered him, <hi>Habebo curam ut te tibi reddam meliorem, quàm accepi;</hi> I will have a care to reſtore thee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thy ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

Thou mayeſt apply this unto thy ſelf: conſider how ungrateful thou haſt bin unto thy God, and it may cauſe thee to bear patiently the injuries that are offered to thee in that kind.

               <note place="margin">Job. 33.6.7.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, I am according to thy wiſh, I alſo am cut out of the Clay, Behold, my terror ſhall not make thee afraid, neither ſhall my hand be heavy upon thee,</hi> Job 33.6, 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The miniſtry of man is a more likely way to do us good, and, in all probability, will be more effectual then the miniſtry of Angels, in ſundry reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Being men like our ſelves, and ſubject to like <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>infirmities as we are,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 5.17.</note> they cannot but ſympathize with us, in our ſorrows: where there is a ſymbolical Quality between Agent and Patient, there is the eaſieſt tranſmutation, (ſaith Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy). If one ſee his own fleſh weep, will not he weep likewiſe? If he ſees his own fleſh afflicted, will he not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate towards it? When <hi>Origen</hi> wept, he ſet all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation on weeping; and when ſome few in a Congregation mourn,<note place="margin">Act. 21.13. 1 Cor. 11.29.</note> it cauſeth the Miniſter to mourn with them. This <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing,</hi> we find in St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 21.13. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115536:89"/>
               <hi>Who is weak and I am not weak?</hi> Who is weak by <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and I not by compaſſion? <hi>Who is offended and I burn not?</hi> that is, am not exceedingly grieved on his behalf? Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> was affected towards the afflicted Churches of Chriſt, (though far remote) as if he had born them on his ſhoulders: Nothing can move compaſſion ſo much, as ſympathizing and a fellow feeling of the ſame affliction. And this was one cauſe, why Chriſt became man; that he might <hi>taſte of our infirmities,</hi> and in that reſpect have a compaſſionate diſpoſition towards us in all our ſufferings,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Being men like our ſelves, we can the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and without fear run to them for Inſtruction, and comfort. We may the more freely and familiarly, reſort to them for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in our doubtings;<note place="margin">Mal. 27. 2 King. 4.</note> for comfort in Afflictions; Knowledge in Ignorance; Inſtruction in Godlineſſe, and aſſiſtance in all wants and weakneſſes <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Familiar dealing is an excellent Art to win Affection. This Familiarity we cannot have with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, (as was ſhewed).</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In that being men, as we are, they might be able to perfect their Doctrine by their Practiſe; that ſo all may know, their precepts are feaſable, by ſeeing them done, (for who can think that that Phyſitian can cure a diſeaſe in another, that is alwaies ſick of the ſame); And that they indeed intended obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, when they ſhall add a <hi>Commentary of practiſe,</hi> to the <hi>Text of Preaching.</hi> This way of Illuſtration of Doctrine, by Example prevailes moſt with the Hearer, who is more apt to believe the Eye than the Ear; in which regard, St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Timothy</hi> to be <hi>an Example</hi> to his flock, both <hi>in word</hi> and in <hi>Converſation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.12.</note> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hereby the danger of deceit and deluſion is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, which we ſhould ly open unto, if we ſhould be taught and inſtructed by the appearance of Angels: For albeit the Truth in an Angel's mouth is <hi>more weighty</hi> in it ſelf, yet it is not more <hi>certain to us;</hi> for Sathan can turn himſelf into <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light,</hi> he can transform himſelf into that ſhew;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14. Dr. <hi>Stough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
               </note> Nor is it an eaſy matter to give ſuch infallible characters, whereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine illuminations might be diſtinguiſhed from diabolical illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that all ambiguity might be taken away. This deceit to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115536:90"/>preven, and for the better ſecurity of our ſouls, God is pleaſed to uſe the Miniſtry of men, and not of Angels, who, albeit they are ſubject to Error, yet far leſſe dangerous then then the former; in that we have a certain rule given us, whereby to try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.1.</note> whether they be of God or no, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. according to which, <hi>if they ſpeak not, there is no truth in them.</hi> And thus you ſee how this way of furthering our good by the Miniſtry of Man, is more likely to be effectual than the Miniſtry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God hath reſpect to man herein, in that by this means he makes tryal of our obedience; Whether we will, for his ſake, ſubmit unto the rule and government of ſuch as he hath <hi>ſet over us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.18. Geo. 22.12.</note> being men like our ſelves (or perhaps inferiour), and yield obedience to him therein, whoſe Will they publiſh. <hi>Now I know</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>that thou feareſt me; ſeeing, for my ſake, thou haſt not ſpared thine onely Son,</hi> Gen. 22.12. God knew <hi>Abraham</hi>'s fear before,<note place="margin">

Gal. 4.14.</note> but now he made experience of it, and ſo as to make both himſelf and others know that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God indeed: So may he ſay to us, if we receive his Miniſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as an <hi>Angel of God,</hi> (as the <hi>Galathians</hi> did <hi>Paul</hi>) not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſo much the meanneſſe of their Perſons, as the truth of their Doctrine; which muſt be as carefully received, and as certainly held,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> as if an Angel from Heaven ſhould deliver it (for ſhould an Angel ſay, Thou ſhalt not forſwear, Thou ſhalt not lye; it is no truer in the Angel's mouth than it is in the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's). Now I know that you fear my name, you have given an experiment of that which is in you; and made manifeſt, both to your ſelves and others, your mind and diſpoſition to fear me and obey me, in a willing and chearful ſubmiſſion to my Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Theſe are ſome reaſons <hi>in reference to men,</hi> (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that might be mentioned,) why God makes choyce of men rather then of Angels, for this ſervice, to dreſſe his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Other reaſons may be drawn <hi>from the work</hi> wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout they are employed, which is Man's Redemption, &amp; eternal Salvation and Happineſſe. Now, as our Redemption was to be wrought and performed onely in the Nature of Man, and not of Angels; ſo there is a decency and fit reſpond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce to that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115536:90"/>work,<note place="margin">Act. 3.22.</note> that our Redemption ſhould be preached to us by Men and not by Angels; and that the gifts of Grace which tend to our happineſſe, ſhould be conveighed to us by the ſame Nature as by a Conduit-Pipe. And this reaſon the Apoſtle ſeemeth to uſe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.18.</note> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>All things are of God who hath reconciled us unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given unto us the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of Reconciliation.</hi> And thus you have ſome Reaſons ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, Why it pleaſed God to make choice of Men, and not of the glorious Angels of Heaven, to dreſſe and husband his Vineyard.</p>

The Prophets of God were to ſtand upon their Watch-Tower to hearken, and to hear what the People did: The like care ought the Miniſters of the Goſpel to have; Therefore they are Styled <hi>Watchmen, Heb.</hi> 13.17. and <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers</hi> of their Congregations, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. They are to have an eye over the life and manners of their People, as the Dreſſer hath on every Vine and Figg-Tree in the Vineyard: without this ſpiritual acquaintance with the State and Condition of our People, we ſhall never be able to apply our ſelves unto them as we ought; We may preach twice every Sabbath, and it may be ſolidly and accurately, and yet not do that good either in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting ſouls, or building up in godlineſſe, as we might, and ſhould do, if we had more frequent and familiar converſe with our People; for then we ſhould be better able to ſpeak unto their hearts, (as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant did unto the heart of the Mayd,) and apply our ſelves unto their Particular eſtates. And thus I have acquainted you (in <hi>general</hi>) with the work of the Miniſter, the Dreſſer; In the faithful diſcharge whereof they are worthy to be reſpected by their People, and to have that which is required by the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 5.17.<note place="margin">

I would weep according to my Power, and begg according to my Love, now of the one for the other, and then of both for both; and for others alſo, (who with great perilland ſcandal ſee you), that you would not ſuffer theſe great diſſentions to ſpread. And great cauſe we have to do ſo; for.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It would be remembred that all our Labours ſhould meet, in that one term, the <hi>edifying of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> that is, his Church,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.12.</note> 
               <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. Now, the Church of Chriſt is not built up with blowes and noiſe: The Matter of the Temple was framed in <hi>Lebanon;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 6.7.</note> at the ſetting of it up in <hi>Zion</hi> no ſtroak was heard, neither of <hi>Axe</hi> nor <hi>Hammer.</hi> Confuſion of Languages hindred the building of the <hi>Tower of Babel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 11.5.</note> ſo variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſtrife of tongues, is a great lett to Temple-work: whilſt our Languages are ſo variable that we <hi>cannot</hi> underſtand each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or for our Impatiency <hi>will not,</hi> the progreſſe of the Church is hindered. Our contentions are a ſcandal to thoſe that are without, and a great hinderance to thoſe that are within; It keeps many from us; opens the mouths of many againſt us; weakens the hands of ſuch as remain with us, and encourageth others to forſake and leave us: when as by Unity and Concord, the credit of our Miniſtry would be greatly ſtrengthened; our Doctrine more regarded, and become more fruitful and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115536:100"/>in the hearts of our people, as appears by that we read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.25.</note> Where the conſent and agreement that was found amongſt God's Servants in their Miniſtry, is rendred as the reaſon of that ignorant man's falling down on his face and worſhipping, this extorted from him an acknowledgment that <hi>God was in them indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The great advantage that we give unto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and adverſaries of the Truth, would not be forgotten. <hi>Melancthon</hi> (a man famous in his Generation) perſwading the Proteſtants, in his time to be at peace and unity, propounded to them a Parable of the Wolves and Dogs, who were marching to fight, the one againſt the other; the Wolves ſent out their Scout to know the ſtrength of their Adverſary; the Scout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, and tells the Wolves, that indeed the Dogs exceeded them in number, but yet they needed not to fear them, for he had obſerved, that the Dogs were not one like another; Beſides, he had obſerved in them, that they did march as though they were offended, rather with themſelves than with their enemies; grinning and ſnarling, yea, biting and tearing one another, as if they would ſave their enemies a labour; nor did they keep their ranks, nor obſerve any order in their march, wherefore let us not be diſcouraged (ſaid the Scout to the Wolves), but march on reſolutely. You can eaſily apply it: Our diſcords are the ſweereſt Muſick in the ears of Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have weakned us &amp; ſtrengthned them. Sirs, (ſaid <hi>Dion</hi> to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious ſouldiers,) your enemies ſee your mutinous behaviour, (pointing to the Caſtle wherein their enemies were;) Oh! that we would ſpend more then a few thoughts upon it; our enemies ſee, and are glad to ſee, and make uſe of what they ſee, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our differences and diſcords, and clap their hands to ſee us wring ours. Highly to be commended were <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> who perceiving the <hi>Arrians</hi> to improve a difference that was betwixt them, to the prejudice of the Orthodox Faith, were ſoon reconciled, and united their forces againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy. And we read in ſtory that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> perceiving the open ſcandal that was like to ariſe by reaſon of the contention ſprung up betwixt him and <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> he beſought him mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after this manner; Sir, We both are no mean men in this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115536:101"/>Commonwealth; our diſſentions will prove no ſmall offence unto others, nor diſparagement to our ſelves: Wherefore, good <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> let us be at one again, and if we will ſtrive, let us ſtrive who ſhall exceed the other in Virtue and Love: Oh! that there were ſuch a ſtrife between Miniſter and Miniſter! Such a ſtrife would be our glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Unity and concord amongſt God's Miniſters is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acceptable, and pleaſing unto God, and delights his ſpirit. In the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13.<note place="margin">2. Chron. 18.</note> we read, that when the Trumpeters and Singers were as one, to make one ſound to be heard in prayſing and thanking the Lord; there the Houſe <hi>was filled with a Cloud, even the Houſe of the Lord:</hi> God drew near, and manifeſted his gracious preſence amongſt them.

                  </gap>endum Spiritum ſanctum,</hi> that unity and concord is the beſt diſpoſition of the mind, for receiving of the holy Ghoſt. But on the other ſide God is not preſent with his favour; his ſpirit abides not where diſcord and diſſention is: That merry <hi>Cardinal</hi> intimated as much to his fellows, in the Conclave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they could not agree about the choice of the Pope, Let us (ſaid he) untyle the Houſe, <hi>quia Spiritus ſanctus nequit ad nos per tot tecta ingredi,</hi> becauſe the Holy Ghoſt cannot get in unto us through ſo many Tyles: Differences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions amongſt us, keeps Gods ſpirit from us: Nay, yet more;</p>
            <p>It cauſeth God to be highly offended with us, and to ſmite us when we agree not, that we may be made to agree together. A very remarkable paſſage hereof we read in <hi>Socrates</hi> great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and contention did ariſe betwixt two famous Biſhops,<note place="margin">Socrat.

Many were ſlain in taking parts; the Cathedral Church and Senate Houſe in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was burned to the ground, in perſuit of revenge; A fearful preſident of Gods diſpleaſure againſt the diſcords of his Servants; think how God loathes that which he ſo ſeverely puniſheth: <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Hoper</hi> could not agree about <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> God made them to agree in <hi>red.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, Let us make our peace with God; for till that be done, no peace can be expected with man, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7, 9.

Queſtionleſſe, our diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Paenal and Judicial puniſhments, for that willful Rent which hath bin made amongſt us; and till God be appeaſed ſtill
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115536:102"/>diſſention will abide. You may read, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.4. of <hi>two</hi> Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Staves,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, Let our care be to ſtock our ſelves well with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſdom, that Heavenly wiſdom which is from above; that is, with the knowledge of Divine things. Such I hope is the Reſolution of the aſſociated Miniſters of this County, as appeares by their agreement.<note place="margin">Eſſex.</note> 
               <hi>We reſolve through the grace of Chriſt to contend daylie, to the comprehenſion of that Ministerial knowledge and wiſdome, whereby we may underſtand our way; and to ſtudy more, and ſtrive after that excellent Wiſdom, and Art of winning Souls,</hi> &amp;c.

               </gap>hat it will not ſuffer us to admit of any error; or do any thing <hi>againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.

Hence was it that ſuch care was had in the Primitive times to maintain the Truth, and not give way to the ſmalleſt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115536:102"/>Errors, where the conſequence might prove great. In the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> there aroſe a difference about one little word, a <hi>Monoſyllable,</hi> the queſtion was about <hi>Ex</hi> and <hi>In.</hi> The Heretiques (condemned then) confeſſed Chriſt to be <hi>ex duabus naturis,</hi> compoſed of two natures at firſt; but not to be <hi>in dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus naturis,</hi> not to conſiſt of two natures after; and for that <hi>In</hi> they were thruſt out.

               </note> either to admit the one, or omit the other: Nothing is to be neglected as little, from which great things may ariſe. So, for the placeing of words, what difference hath bin, and is? as betwixt <hi>ſola fides</hi> and <hi>fides ſola,</hi> nay, very pointings may alter the caſe, as, <hi>John</hi> 17.3.

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Meekneſſe</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſſe</hi> is another branch of that Wiſdom that comes from above; This meekneſſe of wiſdom will give a Charitable cenſure of other mens ſayings and actions, and take things (not in the worſt, but) in the beſt ſenſe; it ſhuns all bitterneſſe of contention about differences in our reaſoning about them: If we reaſon one with another, it will cauſe us to do it in a Brotherly manner, and to <hi>follow the Truth in Love,</hi> Epheſ. 4.1, 5. It removes groundleſſe jealouſies and ſuſpitions,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.1, 5.</note> which we are apt to have one of another, (which is the cauſe of many needleſſe diſtempers amongſt us, and hath bin): It will cauſe us to lay aſide all odious Names, and Words of Reproach which ſerve onely to provoke and engender ſtrifes. We ſhould ſooner be re-united, if theſe new-born Names of <hi>Independent</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> did not keep us at ſuch a diſtance (ſaith one that knowes much.)</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Tractableneſſe</hi> or <hi>eaſineſſe to be intreated;</hi> It cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man to hearken to advice and counſel, and reverently to yield to Reaſon; and ſubmit to the Judgement of Superious. <hi>The ſpirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.32.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. Thoſe who reach are ſubject to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and examining of other Teachers, whether their doctrines be ſound and good: and ſo to ſubmit to their cenſure and judgement. There are thoſe who will perſiſt in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and fancies, albeit they have no ſound ground, nor ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon, nor evident proof to induce them to their falſe perſwaſions, yet they will ſtill hold them, albeit all the Miniſters in the World be contrarily minded; Theſe want this Wiſdom which is from above, which cauſeth us to be tractable, and not willful.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, It is <hi>full of mercy and good fruits:</hi> whereby, deeds of Charity ſeem not to be meant, (for they are not the Subject of that diſcourſe) but Mercy towards them that are out of the way, and err from the Truth. Thoſe who are wiſe will pitty ſuch and mercifully ſeek to reduce them to rights, by all means of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Love, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.1, 2, 3.</note> 14.1, 2, 3. There muſt be no deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>him that is weak,</hi> but a receiving of him in Love. If there be difference in Judgment, yet ſhould not this ſever us in our Affections; though they err, and cannot ſee the truth in many matters, (as we think we do,) yet <hi>God hath received them</hi> to mercy, and they may be God's dear Children, and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as well as we our ſelves, (agreeing in Fundamentals).

            <p>Sixthly, This Wiſdom is <hi>without Partiality,</hi> It will not have <hi>the Faith of God in reſpect of Perſons:</hi> Not this to be the Truth, becauſe ſuch a man holds it, (as we fancy): <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid (but he ſaid amiſſe when he ſo ſaid) that he had rather err with <hi>Origen</hi> than think the Truth with other men: And it was too much for <hi>Nicephorus</hi> to ſay, That he was as ſafe in <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s opinion, as he was in the Word of God: This is <hi>to glory in men,</hi>

               <hi>Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf, ſeek them not. Augustine,</hi> and with him almoſt thirty <hi>Biſhops</hi> beſides, had learned this Leſſon of Self-denial, whilſt they agreed either to admit partners into their See's, or elſe to lay down their Epiſcopal Authority, for the Unity of the Church; Thus they reaſoned with themſelves, Did Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from Heaven into our humane members, that we might be made his Members, <hi>&amp; nos de Cathedrâ diſcendere formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and are we afraid to come down from our Sees to prevent diviſion in Chriſt's Members? The like zeal (as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> ſhews) was in <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> againſt himſelf, to avoid the troubles of the Church, <hi>Si propter me eſt illa tempeſt as, &amp;c.</hi> If this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt be by reaſon of me, take me and caſt me into the Sea (like <hi>Jonas</hi>), and ſo let this Tempeſt ceaſe: where are thoſe that will thus deny themſelves for peace? In all our Diſcords and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in the Church, there is too much <hi>Self</hi> to be ſeen. What was ſaid of <hi>Lucilla's</hi> faction, may be truly ſaid of the Diviſions and Fractions that are at this day amongſt Miniſters; Anger bred them; Pride foſters them.</p>
            <p>It were eaſy (as one ſaith) if it were not beyond an Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries patience, to derive all our Schiſms and Contentions, from the <hi>Concupiſcible</hi> or <hi>Iraſcible</hi> Appetite, and reſolve them, either into <hi>Ambition,</hi> or <hi>Avarice,</hi> or <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing hath more ruined the Church of God, corrupted Zeligion, overthrown Piety, than the <hi>Ambition</hi> of the Clergy. <hi>Korah</hi> takes it grievouſly that the Prieſtly dignity was tranſlated to <hi>Aaron,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Pride,</hi> that is likewiſe a principal cauſe of our diſcords; It is a Baſtard begot betwixt a <hi>Learned Head,</hi> and an <hi>unſanctified Heart;</hi> which being once conceived in the ſoul, it cauſeth it to ſwell till it burſts,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.4.

            <p>Thildly, The differences that are amongſt God's Miniſters concern not <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> but <hi>Circumſtantials,</hi> not the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Articles of Faith, which are <hi>neceſſarily to be believed;</hi> But concerning other <hi>Secundary points</hi> of <hi>Theological concluſions,</hi> fit for diſcourſe of a Divine.

            <p>This factious diſpoſition in the Hearers of the Word, hath been a great cauſe of diſſention amongſt Miniſters; for when People have ingaged their affections for their Paſtors, and have ſwelled one againſt another, in their quarrel (as the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates by that ſpeech of his, they are apt to do,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.6.

               </label> may be this; To maintain his Servants Honour and Dignity, and that the World may ſee in what credit and eſteem they are with God, notwithſtanding they are deſpiſed and contemned in the world. <hi>We are made</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.13.

               <hi>as the filth of the World,</hi> or (as the Word may be rendred) the Sweepings of the World, or as the dirt that is ſcraped (ſaith a good Expoſitor) from off the Pavement thereof, (and <hi>we are the off ſcouring of all things to this day;</hi> The Dung-cart (ſaith another) that goes through the City, into which every one brings and caſts his filth: But albeit they are thus in the World's eye, yet they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in God's; they are a <hi>ſweet ſavour unto him.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, God acquaints his Miniſters with his mind, that they may make known to others what He makes known to them. The Viſible Sun caſteth a more Radiant and bright Beam upon Pearle or Glaſſe, that reflecteth it again, then it doth upon groſs and obſcure bodies, that dead the Rayes thereof: So the Sun of Righteouſneſſe caſteth the faireſt luſtre upon that Calling,<note place="margin">Jer. 36.2, —7.</note> which moſt of all illuſtrateth his glory.

Tit. 2.11.</note> and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which they that have learned Chriſt, are taught by his ſaving grace) are too too groſs and pal pable; our Prayers are full of cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Zeal is wanting; our Hearing full of dullneſſe, Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115536:118"/>is wanting; our converſe with others, full of unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Love and Charity is wanting: and yet few lay to heart, their ſaylings in theſe things (and the like) as they ought. It may be, if they fall into ſome groſſe ſin, Swearing, Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſeem to be humbled for it, but Omiſſions of Duties are looked upon with a regardleſſe eye: And there may be ſome Reaſons rendred of it, amongſt others theſe.</p>
            <p>Omiſſions are not ſo contrary to God, nor are they ſo ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the eyes of Men, as ſins of Commiſſions (ſuch as Lying, Swearing, Drunkeneſſe,) theſe (with the Snayl) leave a ſlime behind them; But Omiſſions make no great noyſe, and are ſleighted, under a pretence of Infirmity, and do leſſe trouble the conſcience then the other.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Affirmative precepts do not bind <hi>adſemper,</hi> as the Negative do: I am alwayes bound not to kill, not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eal; but the Affirmative do not bind to the ever doing of them all at all times. Now Intermiſſion being next to Omiſſion, (and under pretence of Chriſtian Liberty) men do more eaſily fall into O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions then Commiſſions and are leſſe ſenſible thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Obſervation of the Affirmative Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth more croſſe a man's nature (which is moſt contrary to virtues Commanded) and brings him under more oppoſition and hatred of the World, then the keeping of the Negative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts do; therefore we are more apt and inclined to omit the Duties of the Affirmative, than of the Negative, and be leſſe humbled for them.</p>
            <p>But if we be as we ought to be, we ſhall take to heart our fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, in not being as we ſhould be, as well as in being what we ought not to be; we ſhall be humbled before God for our not loving, not fearing, not truſting Him enough: for our not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring His Name; not ſanctifying His Sabbaths as we ought, and for our other Omiſſions of Duties required, either by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our General or Particular Calling: and that for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is both more Virtue and Vice practiſed in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatives, then in Negatives;<note place="margin">Mat. 3.10. Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.19.</note> It is more good to do good, then not to do evil; and more evil to do evil, then not to do good; Albeit both the Tree that brings forth evil Fruit, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115536:118"/>that which brings forth no fruit, ſhall be cut down, and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In doing no good, it is impoſſible for a man to abſtain from evil; for not <hi>to gather,</hi> is <hi>to ſcatter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12.3. Mat. 3.4.</note> in Chriſt's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: not to do good, is to do hurt; not to ſave life, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroy it. Vertue and Vice being extreams without mean contraries, which want a Medium, and therefore the abſence of the one <hi>(in ſubjecto capaci)</hi> in a Subject capable of it, argues the preſence of the other; So that if we be deſtitute of Virtue, then are we attended with Troops of Vices:<note place="margin">Mat. 21.44.</note> If our Houſes be clean ſwept of ſpiritual graces, then they are convenient lodgings for unclean Spirits; If we be not indued with knowledge, then we are blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ignorance; if we be deſtitute of Faith, then we are full of Infidelity; if we forbear to do good, then we proſtitute our ſelves to all ungodlineſſe:<note place="margin">Jam. 1.14.</note> and being once drawen away from God, a man eaſily becomes inſnared by his own luſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. Beſides God doth often in juſtice puniſh ſins of Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by giving men up to the Commiſſion of groſſe and open ſins: Now many are overtaken with the ſins of the times, becauſe they lament not the ſins of the times?<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.10, 11.</note> How many are given up to ſtrong deluſions, to believe lyes, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the Truth in Love? And how often is a mans idleneſs and lazineſſe in not doing what he ſhould, made an occaſion of doing what he ſhould not, as it fell out in <hi>Davids</hi> Caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sins of Omiſſion do exceedingly grieve the Spirit of God, and quench it in us; thence it is,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.19, 20.</note> that the Apoſtle having charged the <hi>Theſſalouians not to quench the ſpirit,</hi> (neither in themſelves nor others,) adds immediately, <hi>Deſpiſe not propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.19, 20. Now it is deſpiſed, (not onely when it is openly contemned, but) when it is neglected, and not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto. So <hi>Iſrael</hi> grieved, (yea vexed) Gods bleſſed ſpirit in not hearkening unto his voyce, nor regarding his wonders,<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.10.</note> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.10. Fire (we know) may be quenched, as well by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the fewel, as by caſting on water; So may the Spirit of God, as well by neglecting of the Ordinances, as by falling into other finful courſes. Beſides, Omiſſions challenge the Power of Sanctification in us: Were we ſanctified throughout
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115536:119"/>by the ſpirit of God, we would make as much conſcience to do what God requires, as to forbear the practiſe of that evil he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; The greateſt loſs that poſſibly can betide us, ariſeth from our Omiſſions, and want of doing good; and that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of Life and Happineſſe; which conſiſts in the fruition of God (who is infinitely good,) and is loſt by Omiſſion, and want of good;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb. 12.14.</hi> Poena Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni poenalior eſt, quàm poena ſenſûs <hi>Chryſ.</hi>
               </note> for <hi>without Holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. and the <hi>pain of loſſe</hi> in Hell, is more grievous then the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of <hi>feeling</hi> and <hi>ſmart;</hi> albeit it be not ſo to our ſeeming; Therefore, both in the Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the torments of Hell are termed <hi>damnation,</hi> in reſpect of the loſſe, of an infinite good, which is God; this is Hell in Hell, as the enjoying of God's preſence is Heaven in Heaven. In all theſe reſpects (beſides others that might be ſhewed) great cauſe we have to be greatly humbled before God for our Omiſſions and Neglects, to lay them to heart, and be much affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,</p>

Nor may the Landlord bleſſe himſelf in this, that he did never wring nor gripe the bowels of his Tenants, if he hath not ſuccoured and protected them. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle;) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.28. but,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.28.</note> Is that enough?

            <p>Latter writters conceive, that by theſe three years is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the whole time of Chriſt's Miniſtery on Earth, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Working Miracles; the <hi>firſt three years</hi> of his publique Miniſtery, he planted the Goſpel in the Land of <hi>Jury;</hi> and in the <hi>fourth year</hi> thereof, he was put to death: All which times the Jews continued unconverted; And to this time one year more was added, which was the time of the Apoſtles preaching, and labouring amongſt them: which they neglecting, going on ſtill in their impenitency, were afterwards cut down by the <hi>Romans.</hi>

One was in the firſt year of his Publique Miniſtery, of which we read,<note place="margin">Joh. 2.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> 2.13, 14. at which time he found no fruit, but buying and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Oxen, and Sheep, and Doves in the Temple, making the Houſe of God an Houſe of Merchandiſe.</p>
            <p>A ſecond coming to look for Fruit on that Figg-Tree, was in the <hi>ſecond year</hi> of his Miniſtery, of which we read, <hi>John</hi> 5.1,—9.<note place="margin">Joh. 5.1, —9.</note> and then he wrought that Miracle in healing of a Cripple who
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115536:121"/>lay at the Poole, having had an Infirmity eight and thirty years, for which the Jews cavil at Him, and perſecute Him.</p>
            <p>His third ſolemn going up unto the Temple, was, that we read of,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.4.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> 6.4. where he taught openly, but the People charged him to have a Devil; and the chief Prieſts and Phariſees are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with their Officers for that they apprehended him not. No better Fruit did He find on that Jewiſh Figg-Tree at His three ſeveral comings up, to ſeek for it.</p>
            <p>From this third Paſſover and ſolemn Feaſt, the Figg-Tree ſtood untill our Saviour's Paſſion, which time was the year of this Figg-Tree's reprival; in which year it was that our Saviour propounded this Parable to the <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> and then, after that, this Jewiſh Figg Tree began to fall; the Curſe being executed by degrees upon it, as, God willing, you ſhall hereafter hear more fully. And this opinion ſeems moſt probable.</p>
            <p>But Laſtly, Others conceive that our Saviour in mentioning three years, alludes only to that in the Old Law, Levit. 19.23, 24.<note place="margin">Leut. 19.23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>When you come into the Land and plant all manner of Trees for Fruit</hi> (ſaith God), <hi>then you ſhall count the fruit thereof as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed; three years ſhall it be as uncircumciſed to you, but in the fourth year all the Fruit thereof ſhall be holy to praiſe the Lord withall:</hi> There was a Natural Reaſon of this Law as well as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical; The <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Reaſon, ſay Divines, was, for that the firſt Fruit of Trees being full of moyſture and wateriſh,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Willet</hi> in loc.</note> it was not ſo wholeſome for the People, and likewiſe to reſtrain them from inordinate feeding on it (eſpecially at the firſt) which might breed ſurſets in them: But the <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> was, for that a fruit-Tree requires one year to ſettle the Root after the Plantation; in which regard the Husbandman will not ſuffer a Tree new-ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>I beſought the Lord thrice,</hi> that is, frequently: God doth come to ſeek fruit of man three years, that is, many years, before he commands him to be cut down. God deals with us (ſaith <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>) as the Husband man doth with his Trees; who allows time enough for the ſtanding of them, and uſeth all means to make them fruitful, which if it prevails not, then he cuts them down, and fits them for the fire. And this Interpretation we may ſafely follow, and from hence lay down this Concluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God alloweth and allotteth to every Figg-Tree growing in his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi>

               <hi>a due proportion of time for the bringing forth of fruit.</hi> Or, Where he expects fruits, he allotteth time ſufficient for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three years</hi> you ſee the Husbandman bears with this Figg-Tree. Time long enough, to waite for the proof of it; for if the Figg-Tree bear not Fruit the third year, it will never bear (ſaith one). Had it bin a <hi>Nut-Tree,</hi> or an <hi>Olive</hi> (ſaith another),<note place="margin">Cornel. a Lapide <hi>Mald.</hi> in loc.</note> three years had not bin enough to waite; But it is enough for ſo grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſucculent a plant as the Figg-Tree is; and three years God alloweth it: all which time He waited, and made no complaint thereof unto the Dreſſer, nor denounced Vengeance againſt it (that we read of.)</p>
            <p>To every Nation, to every Church, Congregation, and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon, God allowes a fit proportion of time for produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Fruit, (albeit to ſome more to ſome leſſe, yet) to all ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent): Three years He bore with this Figg-Tree; Forty years ſpace the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had given them in the Wilderneſſe;

            <p>But we read of that Figg-Tree which grew by the way-ſide, that it was curſed for its barreneſſe,<label type="milestone">

            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:115536:122"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Although the time of <hi>Ripe Figgs</hi> was not yet, yet <hi>green Figgs</hi> might have bin upon it, It was a ſeaſon for ſome Fruit,<note place="margin">Vid. Danae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Quaest. in Evang. ſecund. Marc. Quaeſt. <hi>48.</hi> p. <hi>192.163.</hi>

The Figg-Tree (as before hath bin ſhewed you) is a plant (if not altogether barren) that yields a continual ſucceſſion of encreaſe; whilſt one Figg is ripe, another is green; Chriſt looked for ſome Fruit from that great ſhew of leaves; had he found but green Figgs only, it is likely that it ſhould have eſcaped blaſting.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That puniſhment was not inflicted (properly) on the Figg-Tree, but upon fruitleſſe and barren profeſſors, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that Figg-Tree.

            <p>
               <hi>Fly the Luſts of youth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.22. 1 Tim. 3.6. Job 32.7.</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22.) Now the Luſts of youth are <hi>Pride</hi> and Raſhneſſe, Pleaſure and Wantonneſs, contempt of Superiors, and ſuch like. And theſe are the Fruits wherewith the Boughs and Branches of our Figg-Trees in youth are loaden; ſo that God may ſay of the youth of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 3.5.</note> as he ſometimes ſpake of the youth of <hi>Iſrael, The Lord doth take no joy in our young men,</hi> Iſa. 9.17.</p>
            <p>You that are of this year's ſtanding, deceive not your ſelves,<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.17.</note> nor ſuffer your ſelves to be deceived by the Devils ſuggeſtions, nor the temptations of others; Sathan doth moſt violently ſeek to ſeduce your youth, and to-corrupt it; he hath a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſpite at youth to poyſon it; he ſucks after young and ſweet blood eſpecially, hoping that God will never take his leavings; nor marry that Strumpet which he hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times defiled: Indeed, what man of Chaſtity will marry that perſon that hath lived a Harlot in her youth; and can we think that God will? Wherefore arm thy ſelf in this Age of thy Life, againſt diſcouragements of early and timely holineſſe: Doth Sathan, or thine own falſe heart ſuggeſt unto thee, that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects not Fruit from thee in this Age, and that thou mayeſt be too forward; ſoon ripe, ſoon rotten; young Saints, old Devils; <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Oppoſe thou the Lords good will and pleaſure againſt theſe temptations, He requireth the firſt-born for his; the firſt of our Flocks, the firſt of out Fruits; to teach us to whom the firſt of our Selves doth of right appertain: And if the firſt abilities of Soul &amp; Body are to be imployed in His ſervice, Is it fit to ſpend them in the ſervice of Sathan? Will a Prince accept of a Book for a Preſent, that hath the beginning of it rent and torne? And
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115536:126"/>ſhall God accept of thee and thy ſervice, if thou neglecteſt to ſerve Him in thy youth? Beſides, thy youth muſt be devoted, and beſtowed on ſome, (either God or the Devil) and Who hath moſt right to it? Is it fit that God ſhould be fed with the Devils reverſions, and accept of dry nones, when the Devil hath ſucked the marrow out? And doth not experience teach thee, that if the Fruit be nipped in the Spring, there is little hope of any in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn; and if young Saints prove old Devils, yet it oftener falls out on the contrary, that young Devils ſeldome prove old Saints, but old Beelzebubs.</p>
            <p>Yet again, the Devil may ſuggeſt, That in riper years when you grow more ſtayed, and better know what you do; it is then more ſeaſonable to think of being Religious and of bearing Fruit. If ſo, then anſwer him thus.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This is a controuling of God's Wiſom, who expects that Youth ſhould be Fruitful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That none can aſſure thee of thy ſtanding another year in the Vineyard: Look as the Labourers were ſent into the Vineyard,<note place="margin">Math. 20.1, 2, 3.</note> ſo they go out; that is, at all houres. Some dye in youth, as in the third hour; ſome at thirty, and ſome at fifty, as in the ſixth and ninth hours; and ſome very Old, as in the laſt hour of the Day; but who can promiſe his head, that it ſhall have a ſnowy haire? how many dye in youth, in compariſon of one that lives to old age; Although ſome Fruit fall from the Tree by a full and natural ripeneſſe, yet all doth not ſo: more are pulled from it, or wither upon it, by nipping froſts, or are beaten down whilſt they are green, than hang on till it be mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Say thou ſhouldſt live to perfect age, or till thy haires grow gray, Art thou ſure that then thou ſhalt be bearing the Fruits of Piety and Holineſs? Is it not uſual with God to puniſh a luſtful and wretched youth, with a dotiſh age?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Say that God, in the riches of his grace and mercy, ſhould vouchſafe thee Repentance in af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, Conſider <hi>how long we have loytered,</hi> and caſt our ſelves behind hand; much of this little time allowed for ſo great a Work is already paſt, and waſted unprofitably.

               </note> and how little good we have done; how much of our time hath bin ſpent in ſuperfluous Sleeping, Eating, Drinking, (more then Nature requires,) in in prond dreſſing the Body, Tatling, Sporting, and things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſitable, (which might as well have bin left undone as done); or if we call to mind how much of our time hath bin ſpent in ſinful actions, which ought not to be done; we muſt needs confeſſe the greateſt part of our life is conſumed in <hi>Vanity,</hi> and that our <hi>days have bin empty;</hi> and it ſhould provoke us to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful employing of what time remaines, as did that Prince <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernius,</hi> who being told that he ſhould live but ſix years longer, (take what courſe he would) anſwered, that he would then make thoſe ſix years twelve, and he knew how to do it, which was by for beating his wonted ſleep and recreations, by ſetting up Lights every night, which burned continually; by reading and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the way to <hi>live much</hi> in a <hi>ſhort time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The time that remains of our life is <hi>very ſwift and uncertain.</hi> By three <hi>Adverbs,</hi> Time is ordinarily expreſſed in Scripture, <hi>Nunc, Tunc, Olim: Nunc</hi> is only <hi>good debt</hi> that we can reckon upon: <hi>Tunc</hi> is uncertain, <hi>Olim</hi> is <hi>deſperate:</hi> Now as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants uſe to divide their debts, ſome are doubtful, ſome deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſome certain; ſo may we devide the time of Life: <hi>Time paſt</hi> not well ſpent, is but a <hi>Deſperate Debt;</hi> Time <hi>to come</hi> is <hi>doubtful,</hi> therefore the Prophet ſpeaks of it with an <hi>If</hi> Pſal. 90.10. <hi>If a man lives till he be fourſcore,</hi> that is ſuppoſe it be ſo:<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.10.</note> The <hi>preſent time of life</hi> is the only <hi>certain time</hi> and that flyes away full ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

When we look upon a <hi>Sun-Dyal</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the motion of it, every hour of the day (whilſt it is in our Horizon) it ſeemeth to us to pace very ſlowly, (or to ſtand ſtill rather); for whilſt we look upon the Dyall we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive the Sun to move, (albeit it runs many thouſands of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115536:130"/>miles every minute, no arrow can fly ſo ſwiftly, nor bullet with ſuch ſpeed as the Sun goes; could a Bird (ſay ſome) fly round about the compaſſe of the Earth in a minute of an hour, yet the Sun exceeds that Bird in ſwiftneſſe. Sure it is, that however we cannot perceive by ſteady looking on a Dyal, how ſwiftly the Sun paſſeth, yet we may eaſily gather that the Sun ſtandeth not ſtill, by the ſhadow that paſſeth from hour to hour; and, by its running over all the figures from the Riſing of the Sun to the Setting of it, we may conclude, that it is of an incredible ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Thus doth thy life paſſe ſwiftly, albeit the motion be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to thee: thou diſcerneſt not whilſt it is going; but in a ſhort time thou ſhalt find that thy life is ſo far ſpent, that it is near unto a period, ere thou be aware: <hi>My dayes are ſwifter then a Poſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job,</hi>) <hi>they fly away; they ſee no good, they are paſſed away as ſwift Ships,</hi>

            <p>now, can any imagine that ſuch an Age as this is, is ſeaſonable to begin ſuch a work in, as Repentance is? <hi>Nehemiah</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Jews, that in building of the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they laid the heavieſt burthen on the oldeſt men; we are too cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el to our ſelves in putting off the hardeſt task to our latter time. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> goes on;<note place="margin">Hierom. in loc.</note> and preſſeth this Exhortation to young men; <hi>Before the Silver cord be looſed, or the Golden bowle be broken, or the Pitcher be broken at the Fountain, or the Wheel broken at the Ciſterne;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">B. B. Hall. Paraph. in loc.</note> before all our natural and vital Spirits, be utterly exhauſted, and all the Functions and Offices of Life be quite diſcharged, which ſhall be in the laſt act of Death; that they would remember God: For as when the Cord is looſed, and the Bucket broken, and the Pitcher broken at the Well, or the Wheel at the Ciſtern, no water can any more be drawn; So when theſe Vital parts of ours fail, there can be no longer protraction of Life: We would think him little leſſe then mad, that having a great journey to go, and a great load to carry, and having choyce of other luſty Horſes, would lay all
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115536:135"/>his Carriage upon a poor feeble jade, that could ſcarſe ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his legs, or bear himſelf up, and ſuffer the other to go emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet ſuch is thy folly, who putteſt off thy Repentance and amendment of life till thy hairs grow gray.</p>
            <p>Beſides, It will then be very hard to find out the true ground from whence that Repentance of thine ariſeth; and to aſſure thy ſelf of the Truth of it. That repentance which men take up in time of ſickneſſe or old age, and truſt unto, is rather a meer ceſſation from ſin, then true Repentance; ſin leaves them rather than they leave ſin; Or elſe it ariſeth from ſelf-love, and not from the love of God; the Soul being then poſſeſſed with the fear of Death and Hell, which cauſeth them to bewail their former miſ-ſpent lives; And if this be the ground thereof, what is there more then nature in thee? When a Beaſt falls into danger it will ſtruggle to ſave it ſelf: Nor can the Stream riſe higher then the Fountain. Were it out of love which thou beareſt to God, that thou now forſakeſt thy ſins, and reſolveſt to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on holy Duties; why was it not done ſooner? Proceeded thoſe things from love, when they are ſooneſt done, that man ſhall greive that they were done no ſooner.</p>
            <p>And put caſe that thy Repentance ſhall then prove true and ſound, yet it will not be ſo <hi>Acceptable unto God:</hi> for as much as he hath not ſo much honour by the Fruit which we then begin to bear in our Old Age, as he would have by that which we bring forth in Youth. The Repentance of the Theif upon the Croſſe, (which is often pleaded, and from whoſe example ſo many preſume of mercy (and it is a hard caſe (ſaith one) when a Thief muſt guide us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Donne.</note> and be an example to us) albeit it was true, and ſufficient for the Salvation of his Soul, yet it brought not that glory to God, (ſetting aſide the miracle) which it might have done, had it bin earlyer; nor ſo much glory to himſelf. For as he that ſpends his Patrimony prodigally, hath the leſſer portion from his Father in the end; ſo he who ſpends his dayes ſinfully, muſt expect the leſſer glory from God, if in caſe he (in the end of his dayes) obtains a pardon.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as you tender the Salvation of your ſouls, make a due application of theſe things unto your ſelves, and conſider ſeriouſly, whether it will be eaſier for you to amend, and reform
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115536:135"/>your lives now, or hereafter; now in health, or hereafter in ſickneſſe; now when the burthen of your ſins is leſſer, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after when they will be heavier upon your Conſciences; now, when grace is near, or hereafter when it ſhall ſtand at a farther diſtance: And take heed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you add not ſin to ſin, by your delayes: <hi>Say not to thy Neighbour, Go and come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> again to morrow</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi>) much leſſe, ſay ſo to thy God,<note place="margin">Prov 3.28.</note> and to his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirit.

            <p>Firſt, Know that God keeps a <hi>ſtrict account</hi> of all <hi>the meanes</hi> that he hath affoarded unto you for your good; He records the very time when He ſent His Servants unto a People, when they began to Preach, in what King's Reign, and how long they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued preaching unto a People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1. It is upon Record how many Sermons they have Preached,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.1. Hoſ. 1.1. Amos. 1.1. John 4.54. 2 Cor. 13.1.</note> as, <hi>John</hi> 4.54. <hi>This was the ſecond miracle that Christ did when He was come out of</hi> Judea <hi>into</hi> Galilee: So, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. <hi>This is the third time that I am coming unto you:</hi> Account is kept of what good is done at a Sermon, and how many profited thereby, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. and ſo likewiſe of how many Sermons are loſt;<note place="margin">Acts 2.41.</note> and not one converted (without all queſtion.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, God keeps account (and that ſtrictly) as of the meanes; ſo of our <hi>ſeveral provocations</hi> in deſpiſing of thoſe meanes;<note place="margin">Numb. 14.22. Gen. 31.41. Lev. 26.26. Job 19.1.3. <hi>Ainſworth in loc.</hi> Exod. 14.11, 12 Exod. 15.23, 24. Exod 16.2, &amp; 16, 20, &amp; 27, 28. Exod. 17.1, 2. Exod. 32.8. Numb. 11.1, &amp; 11, 4, Numb. 14, 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>They have tempted me now theſe ten times, and have not hearkened to my Voyce</hi> (ſaith God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.22.) which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Ten</hi> ſometimes is taken <hi>indefinitely,</hi> in Scripture, for <hi>many;</hi> As when <hi>Jacob</hi> told <hi>Laban</hi> that he had deceived him <hi>ten t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mes</hi> of his wages, that is, many times, and ſo elſewhere; But it is not to be ſo taken here, for if we peruſe the Scriptures, we ſhall find the ſeveral provocations to be numbred. The firſt was at the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> Exod. 14.11, 12. The ſecond at <hi>Marah,</hi> Exod. 15. 23, 24. A third in the <hi>Wilderneſſe of Sin,</hi> Exod. 16.2. A fourth about <hi>Mannah,</hi> in leaving it till the morning, contrary to God's Command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.20. A fifth about the ſame thing, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to gather it <hi>upon the Sabbath,</hi> Exod. 16.27, 28. A ſixth at <hi>Rephidim,</hi> Exod. 17.1, 2. A ſeventh at <hi>Horeb</hi> in making the golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.8. The eighth at <hi>Taberah,</hi> Numb. 11.1. The ninth at <hi>Kibroth Hattaavah,</hi> Numb. 11.4. The tenth at that time when God thus charged them by their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Pharon,</hi> Numb. 14.1, 2. Thus exact God is in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an account of our provocations, and that to good purpoſe; For,</p>
            <p>God will produce the meanes to witneſſe againſt us if we profit not thereby; So, 1 King. 11.9. <hi>God was angry with</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon on <hi>becauſe his heart was turned from the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael,<note place="margin">1 King 11.9.</note> 
               <hi>which had appeared unto him twice,</hi> ſaith the Text; So God will one day lay this to thy charge, I have ſpoken unto thee twice,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115536:140"/>yea, many times, of the ſame thing; I have wrote four Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, that out of the mouth of thoſe four witneſſes you might believe; I have ſent unto you ſuch a Servant of mine, and ſuch another, yet all to no purpoſe: There is not a Sermon that you have heard, not an Example that you have ſeen, not a Croſſe that you have felt, not a Bleſſing that you have received; but ſhall teſtifie againſt you for your unprofitableneſſe. If a whole County ſhall come in againſt a man at the Aſſizes, you may well think that it will go hard with him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The not profiting by the means, <hi>cauſeth God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of them,</hi> and take them from us, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 5.3,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.3. Amos 6.9, 11. Rev. 2.5. Jer, 7.12.</note> 
               <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 9, 11, This God threatened to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>I will remove thy Candleſtick from thee,</hi> and God made good his word. What God ſpeaks, Jer. 7.12. <hi>Go now to</hi> Shiloh, <hi>where I ſett my name at the first, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſs of my People</hi> Iſrael; So may I ſay, Go to thoſe <hi>ſeven Churches of</hi> Aſia, and tell me if their Candle be not out; their Candleſtick removed as God threatned? And when this cometh to paſſe, <hi>Loe it will come to paſſe</hi> (ſaith God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.33.) <hi>then ſhall they know that a Prophet hath bin amongst them</hi> whom they diſreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.33.</note> When Gueſts begin to play with their meat, and blow over it; the Maſter of the Feaſt bids take away, and calls for a Voyder: When Servants, having a Candle allowed then to light them to their Lodging, let it burn out in waſte, ſitting, ſleeping, or chatting by the fire, the Maſter comes and ſnarcheth away their light, and leaves them to grope in the dark their way to bed. It was not for nothing that God would not that the ſtaves ſhould be plucked out of the Ark when it reſted;<note place="margin">1 King. 8.8.</note> though they were thruſt in and hid, yet there they were to remain to let his People underſtand that if they did not walk worthy of that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he could, yea would call for his Potters to remove it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.2.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The not-profiting by the means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> puts a man into a <hi>worſe condition</hi> then if he never had enjoyed the means (as was ſhewed you in the proof of the Doctrine, by <hi>Corazim, Bethſaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum</hi>). It had bin better for ſuch that they had bin Sodomites and Gomorrheans: And the time will come that ſuch a one will wiſh, I would that I had bin a Sodomite or a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhean,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115536:141"/>rather then a Chriſtian; I would that I had bin an Indian a Pagan, a Turk, an Infidel, rather then an Engliſhman: Not that God ſhews leſſe mercy to us then to them, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our deſpiſing ſo great mercy: It will be worſe with us then with them,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.2, 3. Dan. 9.11. 2 King. 1.19. Mat. 33.32.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, For this is a ſin that <hi>haſtens wrath,</hi> and <hi>encreaſeth vengeance,</hi> Dan. 9.11. It calls to Vengeance as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine did to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 King. 1.19. <hi>come down quickly.</hi> It fills up our meaſure the ſooner, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.32. The Old World was very ſinful, but it filled not up the meaſure, till it deſpiſed <hi>Noha's warning;</hi> nor was the meaſure of the <hi>Sodimotes</hi> filled, till they came to deſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e <hi>Lot.</hi> When once God's Prophets come to be ſcorned and derided, then the Veſſel becomes full, it can hold no more. Then the wrath of the Lord aroſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> up againſt His People, ſo <hi>that there was no remedy,</hi> 2 Chron. 36.15, 16.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36.15, 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Nor is God ever ſo <hi>terrible or fierce againſt any in wrath,</hi> as againſt thoſe who have had the beſt means, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſpiſed them. <hi>The ſinners in</hi> Sion <hi>ſhall be afraid,</hi> Iſa. 33.14.<note place="margin">Iſa. 33 14.</note> they muſt expect devouring burning; <hi>Tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh upon every ſoul that doth evil upon the Jew firſt, and alſo upon the Gentile;</hi> Rom. 2.9. And how, <hi>on the Jew firſt?</hi> not onely for order of time,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.9.</note> but for greatneſſe of puniſhment. Who can read that threatning without aſtoniſhment,<note place="margin">Jer. 7.13,—13.</note> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.13,—17 and again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.—28. God ſent his Servants, yea <hi>all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> to forewarn that People; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>25</label> they roſe early, gave them warning time enough to prevent danger; <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>28</label> but when they reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed all Propheſies and Warnings, then followes that final and fearful ſentence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>The Lord hath rejected and forſaken them:</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>29</label> Them, whom? Why <hi>the Generation of his wrath,</hi> There is unſupportable horror in <hi>wrath,</hi> but in the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of his wrath</hi> it is infinitely aggravated; As if they were a People upon whom God would exerciſe not ſome one act of his indignation, but multiply acts of his wrath on them, and that continually. It was a ſad Complaint which in that reſpect the Church makes, Lament. 1.12. <hi>never ſorrow like unto Her ſorrow.</hi> Oh!<note place="margin">Lament. 1.12.</note> that it may never happen to this Church of <hi>England</hi> to make the like Complaint. After the cleareſt flaſh of lightening,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115536:141"/>followeth the terribleſt clapp of thunder; Me thinks if theſe things were thought ſeriouſly upon, and laid to heart, they could not but work a greater care in us then formerly; to profit by the means of our good. But I forbear any further application of the point, give me onely leave to acquaint you with what the Oracle foretold of the City <hi>Nyna;</hi> that it ſhould never be won till the River became an enemy unto it<note place="margin">Nyna.</note> which afterwards came to paſſe; for through aboundance of rain the River ſo encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that it overthrew the Walls thereof. I wiſh that what that Oracle foretold of <hi>Nyna</hi> may not be verified in us, in reſpect of plenty of means enjoyed; Plenty of means hath cauſed (through our corruption) a Deluge of Opinions, and that ſuch an Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hereſie and Schiſm, that (it is to be feared) if no ſluce be made to let out and draw thoſe waters, not onely the Citty, but the Kingdom will be ruined; <hi>For if a Kingdom be devided againſt it ſelf, How can it ſtand?</hi> But of the <hi>Complaint</hi> enough: Come we now unto the <hi>ſentence denounced</hi> againſt this Tree, for its barrenneſſe.</p>

            <p>Could He not as eaſily have done it, as ſpoke it? Yes, without queſtion; But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is God's uſual manner to ſpeak before He ſtrikes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Judgment, before He Executes it:</hi>

            <p>I might be large and long in the proof of this, and bring many Inſtances for the confirmation of the Point, I ſhall trouble you onely with a few.</p>
            <p>Before God brought the flood on the Old World, He gave warning thereof, Firſt, He acquainted <hi>Noah</hi> with his purpoſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.13, 14.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.13, 14. Heb. 11.7.</note> 
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. and by him he warned the World in the building of the Ark; every blow that was given with Axe or Hammer in the making thereof, was a <hi>warning piece</hi> before the <hi>murtkering-piece</hi> was Diſcharged: His pains taken in the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of toat Ark to eſchew wrath, condemned the ſecurity of the World which would not be warned.</p>
            <p>The cry of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was <hi>very great,</hi> and their ſins grievous; yet God would not deſtroy them before warning gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; He ſends <hi>Lot</hi> amongſt them, who (without doubt) Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed daylie to them; not onely by his regular and examplary life, but likewiſe by his perſwaſion to Repentance and Obedience: <hi>For that righteous man</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>dwelling amongſt them, in ſeeing and hearing,<note place="margin">2 Per. 2.8.</note> vexed his righteous ſoul from Day to Day with their unlawful deeds,</hi> 2.

            <p>Secondly When they are caſt out of their prayers: God locking up the hearts of his Children, ſo that they do not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them; or withdrawing the ſpirit of prayer from his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo as that they cannot heartily ſolicite God on their behalf, (albeit they are deſired); God ſeeming to ſay to his Children (as he ſaith by his Prophet, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.4.

            <p>The ſecond degree mentioned by our Saviour is <hi>withering</hi> and this muſt needs follow upon the former; for how can that branch but wither that receives no Life, or Sap, from Him that gives the life of ſap to all? So the ſtony ground,<note place="margin">Luke 8.6.</note>

            <p>Thirdly, They wither in their <hi>Practiſe,</hi> (as did the <hi>Galathians</hi> before mentioned, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.3. they <hi>began in the ſpirit, but did end in the fleſh;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.3.</note> they <hi>ran well</hi> for a time, but <hi>gave over</hi> obeying of the Truth,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.7.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>God's ſevereſt Judgments have alwaies moſt equitable Reaſons.</hi> When God ſtrikes, there is ſome Cauſe evermore, ſome Motive, for the inflicting of evill, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.10, 11. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.39, 40. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 57.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30.15. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30.</p>
            <p>It is a natural Concluſion, (as well as Divine,) that when God is angry he ſtrikes and when he ſtrikes he is angry. This Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſpeaking of the Barbarians cenſure of St. <hi>Paul</hi>) was common in all ages, that thoſe who were grivouſly
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115536:163"/>puniſhed, had grievouſly offended. For God (to the end, that he might make the world without excuſe) would have this deeply rooted in the minds of all men, that calamity and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity (and chiefly, notable deſtructions) were teſtimonies and ſigns of his wrath, and juſt vengeance againſt Sin; and there upon did the very <hi>Barbarians</hi> conclude againſt <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 28.4.</note> that he was <hi>a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,</hi> when they ſaw the Viper, hang upon his hand, that had leaped out of the fire; whom, though he eſcaped the Sea, yet <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance would not ſuffer to live, Acts</hi> 28.4. That God ſtrikes not in ſuch anger, but with relation to ſin, is a Doctrine that a man need not to be catechized in; He needs not read Fathers nor Councels, nor Schoolmen, nor Summiſts, nor Caſuiſts, (ſaith one) no, nor the Bible it ſelf, (out of which, we may bring mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of proofs to ſtrengthen it): The very natural man can ſo conclude, albeit he may err when he comes to particulars; as thoſe men of <hi>Malta</hi> did, who deſcended haſtily and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to particular and perſonal Application. Had they known <hi>Paul,</hi> or known him guilty of Murther, or any ſuch heinous crime, there had been ſome ground for their cenſure: For when the ſins of any are notoriouſly and manifeſtly known unto us (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, if they be ſuch as God hath threatned to puniſh with ſuch Judgments;) in ſuch a caſe it is not unlawful to judge, That for thoſe ſins God hath juſtly ſmitten them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.6, 7. But when we judge a man guilty of ſome great ſin, (albeit we know no ſin by him) onely for the Affliction that he endures, and the Judgment of God that is upon him, is great raſhneſſe; And for this, <hi>Job</hi>'s friends were reproved ſharply: Thus the men of <hi>Malta</hi> failed, they judged that the Judgment upon this man, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was an evidence of his guiltineſſe in this offence of Murther; (For there were many crimes, and thoſe Capital, and ſuch as would have induced death, on this ſide of Murther,) but they ſtopped at none till they came to the worſt, and therein they tranſgreſſed the bounds of Charity, and were faulty. But that God is angry when he ſtrikes, and that he hath juſt cauſe to ſtrike when he doth, is an undeniable Concluſion, from the Dictare of Nature as well as Scripture.</p>

            <p>Yet when any Judgment lyes upon us, we are too apt to think that God deals therein over-ſeverely with us; and are ready to caſt a ſullen frown upon God, with <hi>Cur me coedis?</hi> Why doſt thou ſmite me?

            <p>Thus, as God puiſheth alwaies <hi>de condigno,</hi> ſo ſometimes <hi>de congruo &amp; in analogo;</hi> He alwaies puniſheth Sin in ſome kind,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115536:166"/>and ſometimes in its own kind, according to that of the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14.<note place="margin">Pro. 14.14</note> 
               <hi>The Backſlider in heart ſhall be filled with his own waies.</hi> And this he doth, that mens puniſhments may be as Glaſſes, wherein their ſins may be ſeen more clearly; if not for their Repentance, yet for the warning of others.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes, God is pleaſed to puniſh Sin with <hi>contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties: Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were united and combined in the Sin of Murther, therefore they ſhall be <hi>devided and ſcattered</hi> in the Land of <hi>Iſrael,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.7.</note> Gen.</hi> 49.7.

               <note place="margin">Joel 1.9, 10.</note> Joel 1.5, 10. And thus we may find ſome proportion in the diſproportion that is betwixt the Sin and Puniſhment; and, in the Judgment inflicted, read the abuſe of the contrary Mercy.

            <p>The Reaſon is rendered in an Interrogatory way, Why?

            <p>That which we read,<note place="margin">Ezek. 15.1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. is worth our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the unfitneſſe of the Vine-branch for any work, the unuſefulneſſe and unprofitableneſſe of the Hypocritical <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> is ſet forth: The Vine is a noble Plant, in reſpect of the Fruit it bears; but, being barren and fruitleſſe, it is uſeleſſe: The Aſh ſerves for Plough-boote and Cart-boote; The Oake for Gate-boote and Stile-boote; Thornes and Buſhes for Hedge-boote: Old doated Trees (as we ſay) for Shinn-boote. But of all Trees, the wood of the Vine is unſerviceable; It is not fit to make ſo much as a Pegg to hang any Veſſel thereon: <hi>Lo, ſuch is</hi> Iſrael (ſaith God), if it bare good Fruit, it would be dear and precious unto me; but being barren and unfruitful it is of no uſe, unfit for any ſervice.</p>
            <p>Many Compariſons and Reſemblances are uſed in Scripture to ſet forth the unprofitableneſſe of a barren Profeſſor.<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.5.

Other things when they have loſt their ſavour, recover it by the virtue of ſalt applyed unto them; but if ſalt if ſelf have loſt its ſavour, nothing is able to fetch it again. There is nothing in nature that can reſtore it to its former quality; Other things (even after their corruption) may be uſeful for ſome purpoſes: Sowre Wine makes Vinegar, Raggs Paper, Soyl and Rubbiſh is good to fat the ground; but ſavourleſſe ſalt is good for nothing but the Dunghill; nor is it fit for that, and therefore muſt neceſſarily be <hi>trodden under foot,</hi> as utterly unprofitable, which is not onely a thing <hi>Calamitous,</hi> but extreamly <hi>Ignominious.</hi> Neither is the dumb and unprofitable Miniſter onely, this unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouty ſalt (albeit Chriſt directed that Speech to his Apoſtles); but every Profeſſor of godlineſſe that hath denyed the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whoſe <hi>ſpirit</hi> is barren of the Fruit of good <hi>Motions,</hi>

            <p>Firſt, A barren Tree poſſeſſeth the place of a better, and by its good will would not ſuffer any to grow near it; The beſt Rooms at Feaſts, the chief Seats in Synagogues,<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.8.

            <p>The like may be ſeen in <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>caſe,</hi> who was annointed to be King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> long before his Inſtallment: <hi>Saul</hi> ſat yet upon the Throne, and <hi>David</hi> muſt be content to ſtay a while for that, till <hi>Saul</hi> be removed; and, that being done, then he ſhall be planted and ſeated in his room, in <hi>Hebron:</hi> So whilſt <hi>Judas</hi> ſupplyes the place of an Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 2.1.</note> honeſt <hi>Mathias</hi> ſhall be kept out;<note place="margin">Acts 1.20.</note> his place muſt be Voyded, before another take his Biſhoprick, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20.

            <p>Secondly, Such as are barren and unprofitable in their places, devour not only equal nutriment with him that beareth, but many times ſtarve other inferiour plants within their reach; drawing away the heart, and fat of the Soyl with their Succours and Feeders: What a breadth beareth ſome great Aſh or Oak? How far do their Roots ſpread, albeit under ground, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen? Yet, it may be perceived by their ſoaking of the ground, and drawing away nouriſhment from Corn and Plants, that are near unto them: It is thus with many an unprofitable and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren

            </p>
            <p>That large and liberal maintenance allowed formerly by our fore-Fathers charity, for pious uſes (as towards the maintenance of the Miniſtry, ſuccouring of the poor and needy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) a great part thereof was formerly devoured by idle Moncks, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved like droans, and minded nothing ſo much as their Bellies; and (to mend the mater) was afterwards taken from them, and given to others, who ſpent that which was ſo charitably given, upon Hounds, and Whores, and ſuch like vitious practiſes. <hi>Comineus</hi> obſerved, upon a battle fought in <hi>France,</hi> ſome loſt their Livings by running away, and they were given to ſuch as had out-ran them ten miles; So it is in this Caſe, we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (ſaith one) from <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and given to <hi>Rapists:</hi> that which is due to Miniſters for their maintenance, and to the poor for their ſuſtenance, is ſoaked away by ſome barren <hi>Impropriator,</hi> and Sacrilegious Church-Robber; This many a Pariſh, in this Nation, can teſtifie.</p>
            <p>How many are there in the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> which being in Office, and having Rule and Government in their hands, by Oppreſſion and extortion (or ſome other indirect courſe) draw from thoſe, whoſe back and bellyes pinch for it, they having ſcarce bread to put into the mouths of themſelves and Children?

Out of the painful and laborious Silke-worm, ariſeth a painted But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flye; Through the waſteful Prodigality of one Spend-thrift, many under-Plants are undone, and drawen ſapleſſe; the Wife is brought to miſery, Children to beggary, through the profuſe expence of ſome ryotous Husband or Parent, who in a ſhort time conſumes a fair Eſtate, and large Patrimony. <hi>There is Treaſure to be deſired,</hi>

The meaning of which Proverb is, that is the care of a wiſe man to keep that which is beſtowed on him through God's bounty, and his own endeavours; but an unthrifty perſon by his Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, laviſheth out his ſubſtance, and maketh himſelf a pit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his great Eſtate, yea, and Family is ſwallowed up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured. Thus you ſee, how the under-Plants both in <hi>Church, Common-wealth,</hi> and <hi>Private-Family,</hi> come to be ſoaked in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that concern <hi>this Life,</hi> by a barren and over-topping Figg-Tree.</p>
            <p>And the like might be ſhewed you how good Plants are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hindered, in their growth <hi>in things ſpiritual,</hi> by ſuch barren profeſſors that grow near them.

            <pb n="319" facs="tcp:115536:170"/>
            <p>Thirdly, They are troubleſome and cumberſome to other Plants by their <hi>unprofitable ſhade,</hi> over-topping and over-drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them, and keeping the influence of Heaven from them, ſo that they cannot enjoy the warm-beams of the Sun, which brings <hi>healing</hi> with it <hi>under its wings.

               <hi>When the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are in Authority, the People rejoyce</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>); <hi>but when the Wicked bear Rule, the People mourn,</hi> Prov. 29.2. Let a wicked man be in place of Power or Command, either in Town, City, or Country, he employes his Strength and Power to do miſchief; (like the <hi>Ape</hi> or <hi>Monkey,</hi> which being got up to the top of the Houſe, flings down tiles upon the heads of Paſſingers, and makes mouths and faces at them, or playes ſome unhappy trick or other): if not ſo, yet by their Examples and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they ſo over-drop the under Plants, and keep them under check, that they cannot thrive and proſper under their ſhadow,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.48, &amp; 9, 22.</note>

            <p>Fourthly, They are cumberſome, in <hi>harbouring</hi> under their Branches <hi>things hurtful</hi> to other Plants; None ſhall be harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under their ſhade, unleſſe it be a ſlinging Nettle, or ſome ſullen Weed, or ſome venemous and poyſonful Crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fifthly they are burthenſome <hi>to the Lord of the Soyle,</hi> and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Vineyard, who complains of ſuch barren Plants, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.14,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.14, 24, &amp; 7, 13, &amp; 43, 24.

            <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Dreſſers of the Vineyard</hi> are burthened and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered by them; <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Principal Dreſſer laments the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe of <hi>Jeruſalem, Luke</hi> 19.41. <hi>Math.</hi> 23.34. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.38.<note place="margin">Luke 19.41.

For as the thriving of the Flock is the glory of the Shepherd; and the flouriſhing and fruitfulneſſe of the Trees, the praiſe of the Gardiner; ſo on the contrary, when things thrive not under their hands, they ſuffer by it. The <hi>Cynick</hi> ſpying a Boy unmannerly, did ſtrike his Maſter that did teach him: So the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> told Chriſt of his Diſciples fault, as if it had tended to his Diſgrace: Thus do men of this Generation, they lay the blame of barrenneſſe upon the Dreſſers Back; as if it were onely their fault, that the Tree is unfruitfull.

            <p>When God complained to <hi>Moſes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s wickedneſſe, and threatned their deſtruction for their ſtiff neckedneſſe <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.7.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.7, 11. Num. 14.12, 13. &amp; 16.45, 46.</note>

Thus, that good King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when he heard, from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Book of the Law, what great wrath was kindled againſt the People for their ſins, to make them a deſolation and a curſe, he <hi>rent his clothes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 22.19.</note> and <hi>his heart melted, and he humbled himſelf before the Lord, and wept exceedingly,</hi> as we read, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.19. that God's wrath might be averted, and turned away from the People, And when the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was revealed to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> by a Viſion, his heart was ſo affected therewith, that he falls down upon his face, cryes unto the Lord for them, and expoſtulates with the Lord on their behalf;<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.8.</note>

            <p>God's threatnings are not cauſleſſe, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115536:174"/>Great things have been obtained from God for a ſinful People, upon the Prayers of his Servants. This is farther declared in that excellent Prayer which <hi>Solomon</hi> made, 1 <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>God never yet threatned any Judgment, againſt a Land, or Nation, or Particular Perſon, but faithfull and fervent Prayer hath either averted it, or deferred it; abated it, or ſweerned it; and ſo far it hath been ſucceſsful, if not for others, yet prayer hath returned into the boſomes of thoſe who have prayed, to their comfort.</p>

But we have no ſuch Inhibition as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had: and, the Lord's Abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree being hid from us, ſo long as a Nation hath Being, we ought not to ceaſe praying.</p>
            <p>Other threatnings and denunciations are <hi>Conditionall,</hi> and not ſo Abſolute, but that they admit of an Intervention of Prayer, Repentance, and Amendment of life.

The like we have, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.1. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was commanded to make his Will,<note place="margin">Iſa. 38.1.</note> and put his Houſe in order; For <hi>thou ſhalt dy &amp;

            <p>And thus are we to underſtand the threatnings (Generally) that are made againſt Sins and Sinners. Comminations and Threatnings are the heavieſt Texts that we can light upon in the Scriptures, and they are the ſaddeſt and heavieſt Commentaries, (ſaith a great Divine of our own,) that a man can make upon theſe Texts. When God hath awakened a man out of his Dream,<note place="margin">Dr. Donn 2. <hi>Vol. p.</hi> 71</note> and rowſed him up out of the Bed of his ſecurity, he ſuffers him to read to the <hi>Quia,</hi> but not to the <hi>Tamen:</hi> he comes to ſee a Reaſon of that Threatning, of that Judgment, that ſhall befall him; but not to ſee the Remedy: His Eye is carried to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places of Commination, againſt ſuch ſins as the Land is guilty of, or himſelf is guilty of, and there makes a <hi>Period,</hi> a full ſtop. But he reads not with a <hi>Comma,</hi> he makes it not as an imperfect Sentence; he takes not in what followes, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, or implicitely; he takes not in the Remedy, the Relief: Yet <hi>turn to God,</hi> by Humiliation, by Prayer, then <hi>God will turn to you.</hi> How heavy ſoever God's threatnings are againſt a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any Particular Perſon in that Nation, yet ſtill there is room for <hi>David's</hi> Queſtion, <hi>Quis ſcit,</hi> Who knoweth whether God will be gratious or no? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22.<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.22.</note> There is no room for it, as it is a <hi>Queſtion of diffidence</hi> and diſtruſt; every one of us muſt know it and believe it, that there are Conditions upon which the Lord will be gratious: Be they ſpoken never ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory, and ſet down never ſo abſolutely, yet God hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himſelf power of Revocation, in caſe he be ſought unto by Prayer &amp; Repentance.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Know, that God's eternall Decree, takes in the <hi>Means</hi> as well as the <hi>End;</hi> ſo that, according to God's Decree, when his threatning of ruine and deſolation is gone out againſt a Land or Nation; Prayer, and other Means, falling in to hinder

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115536:179"/>17.9, 10, And for their ſakes, Chriſt now makes Interceſſion unto his Father, that he would deferr his wrath; and that the World may ſtand, till that the number of his Elect be made up, (which otherwiſe had not ſtood to this day), and no ſooner ſhall that number be made up, but the world ſhall be conſumed with fire.</p>

               <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. He is <hi>the Door,</hi> and the <hi>way,</hi> through which onely acceſſe is gotten to God; by <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> we have not this acceſſe, but by Chriſt onely.</p>
            <p>They, of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would perſwade us otherwiſe; they tell us that Chriſt indeed is the onely Mediatour betwixt God and us, touching <hi>Redemption;</hi> but there be other Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> namely, Saints and Angels, who, albeit they be not the Redeemers of the World, yet they are as the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heaven, and ſpeak a good word for us, and ſo may be come unto, by us.</p>
            <p>But what warrant have they for this diſtinction in the word? That <hi>Saints living</hi> on Earth, may intercede for us; (and How, we ſhall ſhew you anon,) but that the <hi>Saints departed</hi> do it for any particular Perſon, we utterly deny.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1. 1 Tim. 2.4.</note> The Scripture tells us expreſly, that there is but <hi>one Advocate,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. and <hi>one Mediator between God and Man,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.4. and no more; and (which is to be obſerved) that in the ſame place, where the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of one <hi>Mediatour betwixt God and Man,</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> that then he intreats of, is <hi>Prayer;</hi> ſo that, even in Prayer, he would not that we ſhould acknowledge any other <hi>Mediator of Interceſſion,</hi> but Chriſt alone.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, To communicate Chriſt's Prieſt hood, or any part thereof, with any other beſides his own Perſon, or uſe any other Mediator for Interceſſion, beſides him; is (in effect) to deny (that which Scripture ſpeaks,) that Chriſt is able to the <hi>utmost to ſave thoſe that come unto God through him.</hi>

            <p>But (to follow this chaſe no farther) let us not partake with them in their error, but cleave cloſe to the Interceſſion and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, which God hath ordained for us, in the Perſon of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; reſting aſſured, that he is both <hi>willing</hi> to ſtep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, and <hi>able</hi> to procure us favour, in the ſight of God his Father, and bring us into a ſtate of Grace and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with him: He is our onely <hi>Maſter of Requests,</hi> let us know no other if we would ſpeed in our Suits: He is a Saviour <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> a thorough Saviour, and needs not any to come after him to finiſh what he hath begun; he doth not his work by halves.

               <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.11, 13. yet he goes as far as he might, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21, 22. He might and ought (and did as he ought) to pray for other Bleſſings of God, in their behalf; As that He would give them Repentance, Remiſſion of Sins, Redemption

            <p>
               <hi>Intercede,</hi> is properly a Latine word, and ſignifieth to come betwixt, and ſo to Lett, Hinder, Withſtand,<note place="margin">Inter <hi>et</hi> cedo. Cameron? de p. <hi>122.</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>1 Tim. 2.1.</hi>

            <pb n="344" facs="tcp:115536:183"/>
            <p>But uſually and <hi>more ſtrictly,</hi> it ſignifieth that part of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Chriſt, in which he appears before God to prevent, or pacifie his diſpleaſure towards his Elect (of which we ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore); And this is out of <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Authority.</hi> To be ſuch an Interceſſor, belongs to Chriſt alone, becauſe Interceſſion as it is a <hi>publique</hi> and <hi>authoritative Act,</hi> is founded upon the ſatisfactory merits of the Perſon interceding:<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.2.</note> He cannot be a right <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi> who is not a <hi>Propitiation</hi> alſo; Therefore the Papiſts are forced to venture ſo far, as to affirm that the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of the <hi>Saints in Heaven</hi> with God for us, is grounded upon the virtue of their own merits: But thus, Chriſt onely is our Interceſſor, and no other; neither in Earth nor Heaven. The things we pray for (either for our ſelves or others) are unmerited of us, and undeſerved by us; therefore, we put them up in His name, we expect them, <hi>ex vi promiſſi,</hi> out of Gods gracious promiſe and not <hi>ex vi pretii,</hi> out of any price or purchaſe by us paid or made; ſuch <hi>meritorious Mediators,</hi> God's Miniſters are not: they are but <hi>Miniſterial Mediators</hi> and <hi>Interceſſors</hi> under Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.20.</note> wherein (indeed) they are preferred before others in nearneſſe to Chriſt; and have (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaks) <gap reason="foreign">

And thus you have heard, how God's
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115536:184"/>Faithful Miniſters Intercede for their People, and wherein their Interceſſion (principally) conſiſts: Let me now ſhew you briefly the Grounds or Reaſons of the Point.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They <hi>are hereunto called,</hi> and appointed by God: The Prieſt was <hi>taken from amongſt men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle),<note place="margin">Heb. 5.1.</note> 
               <hi>and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for men in things appertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifice for ſin,</hi> Heb. 5.1. In like manner all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel are taken from amongſt men, and ordained for the good of men, not in matters of this Life, but in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe betwixt God and them, that they may offer up (not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal propitiatory Sacrifice for ſin, as they of the Roman Church would have it, but) thoſe Spiritual Sacrifices and Prayers and Interceſſions unto God, on their People's behalf.<note place="margin">Gen. 20.7.</note> 
               <hi>He is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and He ſhall pray for thee,</hi> was the Language of Elder times. To this they are called, and cannot but make conſcience of their Duty, if they be faithful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Miniſters, (if Faithful) <hi>dearly affect their People</hi> and eſteem them (as <hi>Cornelia</hi> did her <hi>Gracchi</hi>) for their chiefeſt Ornaments: <hi>What is our Hope, our Joy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>our Crown of Rejoycing</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)? 1 Theſ. 2.19, 20. <hi>Are not even ye in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming: ye are our Glory and our Joy.</hi> Now whom we affect, we pray for, plead for, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe what may be; The Child is oftentimes wayward and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the tender Mother rocks it, ſings it, excuſeth it; It doth not uſe to be thus, it hath the frett, or ſome pin pricks it, or it is breeding teeth; it ſhall be any thing, but what it is indeed, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe: This affection carryed St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſo high a pitch, as that he could wiſh himſelf accurſed for his Brethrens ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. and cauſed him (with the reſt of the Apoſtles) to be ſo deſirous of their Peoples good,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.3.</note> as that they were willing not onely to impart the Goſpel to them, but alſo <hi>their own ſouls,</hi> 1. Theſ. 2.8.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.8.</note> Faithful Miniſters are <hi>conſcious</hi> to them ſelves <hi>of their own faylings;</hi> None ſo careful, but have cauſe to ſmite upon their thighes for ſome neglects in their Miniſterial ſervice: This Dreſſer feareth his own faylings, and however the Owner charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Figg-Tree onely for its barrenneſſe, yet the Dreſſer (in the anſwer which he makes) ſeems to charge himſelf with ſome
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115536:185"/>omiſſion of Duty; <hi>I will digg about it, and dung it;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, ſomething hath bin wanting on my part, in not husbanding of it as I ought; Let it alone one year more, and I will redouble my pains and diligence, and amend my fault. In this reſpect, he might Intercede for it: Thus much of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a faithful Miniſter's Interceſſion, for a barren and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table People.</p>

            <p>Two wayes may Interceſſion be ſaid to be made againſt a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;<note place="margin">Resp.</note> Firſt, When a ſimple and bare Relation is made to God of the ſin committed: Secondly, When puniſhment is craved, and called for to be inflicted on them, as they have deſerved.

               <note place="margin">Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. Beza. Paraeus.</note> ſeems to be of the former, not latter kind; He acquainted God with the Impiety of that People, lamented it in God's hearing, was ſorry for it, and grieved at it; but he called not for vengeance to fall upon their heads, he deſired not their ruine: for (queſtionleſſe) he was better acquainted with <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Rule (if he had not too much (through paſſion) forgot himſelf),<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.23.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord, in ceaſing to pray for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If (beſides the complaint made by the Prophet unto God) there be likewiſe a <hi>ſecret imprecation</hi> (as ſome conceive there is),<note place="margin">Calvin.

               <note place="margin">Jer. 18.21, 21, 23.</note> 
               <hi>forgive not their iniquity, put not out their ſin, but deal with them in anger,</hi> Jer. 18.21, 22, 23. And, it was uſual with the Prophets thus to do. We come to make uſe of the Point.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Admit the Proportion ſhould hold betwixt the King of Heaven, and Princes upon Earth; yet the Reaſon holds not; for we are invited to come to Chriſt boldly, and by Him to His Father: The King of Heaven hath commanded that we ſhould mediate only by the Prince his Son: Now, what preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is it to do as we are commanded? Nay, it is audacious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to go contrary to that courſe that is enjoyned.

               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.11.</note> a publiſhed, a declared Sentence) only Execution is deferred; condemned he is <hi>by the Law,</hi> which paſſed ſentence on him, ſo ſoon as ever he was born, before he ever ſaw the Light of the Sun,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note>

Now what favour can a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man expect, or any Friend deſire on his behalf, more then a Reprieve?

            <p>And that is the third conſideration, the Fruit and Effect of ſuch a patient forbearance, which is <hi>Salvation,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. that is,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.15.</note> it makes to Salvation; It is the way to it, the means of it, and Argument for it.

               </note> but long ſince we ſhould have bin in Hell; (Had God bin haſty, to mark what is done amiſſe, and have called us to an account in the days of our vanity). Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have bin ſaved through God's patient forbearance: Not a Penitent amongſt us, but muſt acknowledge, that he owes his Salvation (in a great meaſure) to God's forbearance and patience: And the great Clock of Time is ſtill kept going for this very end and purpoſe, that Salvation may be had, and the number of God's Elect made up; A time of Reprieval is therefore granted, (albeit Sentence be denounced) that, by uſing the means, a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don may be obtained, (which God is ready to grant, being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ſincerely ſought unto); To which end he giveth us his <hi>Word</hi> to direct us in the way; (The Church is the place where Salvation is to be found, of it we muſt be made true members, if ever we be ſaved). His <hi>Works</hi> he affoards for helps; His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are our Interceſſors; All theſe accompany God's Patience, whereby Salvation in the end comes to be attained. And thus you have ſome good grounds for the Truth delivered, <hi>viz. It

            <p>The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> doth notably deſcribe the Patience of God by his laying, firſt, on the one ſide, then on the other a long time together, <hi>Ezek</hi> 4.4. Firſt,<note place="margin">Ezek. 4.4. <hi>Explained.</hi>

Let us then <hi>exalt him</hi> for his patience, and bleſſe his name.</p>
            <p>Yea, let every Soul of us take notice of God's Patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in particular, and magnifie his name for this mercy; Think ſeriouſly with thy ſelf what thou wert, when thou firſt cameſt into the World; no ſooner didſt thou peep forth into the Light, but God might have ſent thee into Hell: And how long thou livedſt without God in the World; yet God's patience hath forbore thee to this hour. How many provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons God hath had from thee all this time? how many Lyes Oaths, Blaſphemies, hath he heard from thy foul mouth? how much wickedneſſe ſeen by thee, how many abominations ſeen in thee? yet he hath gone away (as if he ſaw not), and ſeemed to take no notice of what thou haſt ſaid and done, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21.

Yea he hath hid thy ſins from the eyes of the World, and had a care of thy credit; for ſhould he diſcover what he knows by thee, thou couldſt not but bluſh to look any neighbour in the face; they would ſhun thy company.</p>
            <p>Conſider further, that when thou haſt gone on in thy ſinful and impenitent courſe of Life, ſo that his hand hath bin up to ſmite, (his <hi>patience</hi> being even <hi>weary with bearing,</hi> Jer. 5.7.) his <hi>long ſuffering</hi> hath ſtept in,<note place="margin">Jer. 5.7.</note> and layd hold on the Sword of Juſtice, (as the Angel did on <hi>Abraham's</hi>) and pleaded for thee; Lord remember that <hi>he is but duſt;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But how few are there, that do make uſe of God's <hi>Patience?</hi> Some, inſtead of magnifying Him for it, make bold to queſtion His <hi>Juſtice,</hi> in bearing ſo long with evil Doers: This was <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>'s fault, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.10. and <hi>David's, Pſal.</hi> 73.12, 13.<note place="margin">Jer. 12.10.

            <p>Sometimes an Offender is ſpared in regard of ſome uſe that is to be made of him; It may be, to be the Executioner of ſome other; ſo God may ſpare the wicked for this end, that they may be as wiſps or rods to ſcoure and chaſtiſe his own. Thus <hi>Aſhur</hi> was ſpared for a time, and was ſent againſt <hi>a diſſembling Nation,</hi> Iſa. 10.5, 6.

               <hi>and ſtaff of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</hi> Sometimes God hath ſome good work to do by them for his Church and People: <hi>Cyrus</hi> was an ambitious man, a very Pagan, one that knew not God, and yet he is termed <hi>God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,</hi> and God doth promiſe to aſſiſt him in that work he ſet him about for the good of his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.1.2.<note place="margin">Iſa. 45.1, 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes, Offenders are ſpared in reſpect of the Birth that they travel with; ſo a Woman with child (that is condem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed) is Reprieved till ſhe be delivered; (for however ſhe be wicked, yet the Child in her womb may prove a profitable member to the Common-wealth). So many a wicked man is with child
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:115536:199"/>with ſome ſin, and in <hi>travel with miſchief,</hi> and the Lord ſpares him, till he be delivered of it. <hi>Herod, Pontius Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> were in travel till they had put Chriſt to Death, and God ſpares them till they had brought forth,<note place="margin">Acts 4.27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27, 28. And then the Law is executed on them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes an Offender is ſpared upon the Petition and deſire of ſome other made on their behalf; ſo God ſpared the wicked for ſome good mens ſake who lived amongſt them,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.32 Exod. 32.24. Act. 27.24.</note> (as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.32. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.24.) So here in my Text, the Figg-Tree is ſpared upon the Interſſion of the Dreſſer.</p>
            <p>Sometimes an Offender is put off from the Seſſion to the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes; God Almighty ſuſpendeth and deferreth the juſt, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved puniſhment of the wicked, to inflict it upon them in time, and place, more convenient for his Glory, their confuſion, and the example of others: Thus the blaſphemous miſcreant, <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> was not deſtroyed in the night when his army was,<note place="margin">2 King. 19.37.</note> he is <hi>ſuffered to return</hi> to the place from whence he came, and there he ſhall be ſlain in the Temple of their falſe god <hi>Niſroch,</hi> by the Sword of his two Sons, <hi>Adramelech</hi> and <hi>Sharezer,</hi> whom God uſed as his Inſtruments, to make his puniſhment the more notorious, for his Idolatry and blaſphemy, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19.37. And ſome men are put off to the great Aſſizes, 1 Tim. 5.24. <hi>Some mens ſins are open before hand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.24.</note> going before to Judgment, and <hi>ſome men</hi>'s <hi>they follow after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſometimes an Offender may be Reprived upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, hoping that he will become a new man, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Church or State: So God ſpareth a wicked man upon his Repentance and Humiliation, as he did <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.29. but (more eſpecially) he ſpared his own Elect,<note place="margin">1 King. 21.29.</note> that they may have time actually to repent, and be brought into the State of grace. Thus you ſee that there are many reaſons of God's pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forbearance, ſo that it doth no way impeach his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Justice:</hi> Therefore take heed, leſt any of you <hi>charge God fooliſhly,</hi> whom you ought to magnifie, for his rich patience, and great mercy in ſparing.</p>
            <p>As theſe ſin againſt <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Juſtice</hi> (in reſpect of his Patience), ſo others highly offend againſt the <hi>richneſſe of his goodneſſe,</hi> Rom. 2.4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.4.</note> Many ſuch unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:115536:199"/>and diſſolute ſinners there are in the World; ſo far are they from prizing of this mercy of God, in bearing with them, that they deſpiſe it, making the patience of God but as a fair day to ramble in, after laſcivious vanities; and grow more wanton by God's forbearance. The more patient God is towards them, the more bold they are to offend Him; ſo we read,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.11.</note> Eccleſ. 8.11. <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the ſons of men are fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> or (as ſome read it) <hi>their heart is full to do evil;</hi> full of evil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, full of evil imaginations, full of devices, for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of evil works; Their hearts are ſo full, that there is no room for the fear of God's wrath, no room for the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own danger, their ſinful and naughty hearts turns God's infinite elemency, to an encreaſe of wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Should a Malefactor, after Sentence given, be Reprieved through the Clemency of his Judge, and ſuffered to go abroad, and, upon his good carriage and behaviour, have his Pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed from his Prince; fall to his former outrages of Robbing, and the like, is it not juſt that he ſhould be caught again, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted without mercy?

            <p>Let us caſt our eyes a little upon the pains of the Dreſſer, mentioned in my Text; and it will appear that it is no idle man's Occupation, nor eaſy Vocation, whatever the World thinks.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He is a Digger, and ſo no Loyterer; there is labour and pains in that: And is there no labour (think you) in the work of the Miniſtry? St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his <hi>labours abundant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.23.</note> not ſo much in travelling from place to place, as in teaching the People; So Gal. 4.11. <hi>I am afraid of you,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, From the Text, we may gather what kind of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the Miniſter's labour is; you ſhall find it to be no leight nor eaſy labour; For</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Labor renovatus, A renewed Labour.</hi> This Dreſſer had digged about this Figg-Tree, and dunged it, before now (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion); but that is not enough, he muſt over with his work again; Such is the Labour of the Miniſter. In which reſpect, his Toyle and Travell is parallel'd with the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's, who hath no vacation: He is alwayes doing; either plowing, or ſowing, or harrowing, or weeding, or reaping; Every Seaſon of the Year brings with it a ſeverall Task: And when he hath gone his Round, and may be thought to have finiſhed his work, he is then to begin again,<note place="margin">Redit Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colis labor actus in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem.</note> and fall afreſh to his plowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo from year to year he renews his Labour.</p>
            <p>And in ſome caſe it is worſe than the Husbandman's, and more toylſome; For the Plowman, as he leaves his Ridge, ſo
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:115536:205"/>he is like to find it at his Return; where he pitched his Plough, upon the ſame Furrow he ſhall have it the next day: But we ſeldom find our work, upon our return, in ſo good a forwardneſs as we left it.<note place="margin">Chryſ. <hi>ad pop.

The Art of Teaching is not like other Arts; for the Godſmith, what work ſoever he he frameth, and caſteth in a mold, and layeth aſide; the next day when he returneth to his work, he ſhall find it as he left it: So, the Black-Smith, and the Maſon, and every other Artificer whatſoever, all ſhall find their work in the ſame ſtate as it was, when it was put out of hand: But it is not ſo with us, for after we have taken great pains to reform you, to wean you from the World, and to make you more zealous of good works; you are ſcarce out of ſight, but the Evill One comes, and, with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of buſineſſe and cares of this World, or the wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures of the fleſh, he choaketh that good Seed which we have ſowen in you, and maketh the Word which you have heard to become altogether unprofitable; ſo perverting and corrupting you, as that our work is more difficult to us, then, than it was before.

            <p>Again, The Work of this Dreſſer was <hi>Labor Duplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> a duplicated, or double, Labour: Here is both <hi>digging</hi> and <hi>dunging</hi> of the Figg-Tree; One without the other was not
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:115536:205"/>ſufficient. Chriſt's threefold <hi>Paſce,</hi> enjoyned <hi>Peter</hi> (as ſome conceive) to a three-fold Duty; feed by <hi>Doctrine,</hi>

               </note> feed by <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> feed by <hi>Writing.</hi> It is hard to ſay, that ſuch was Chriſt's meaning, but it is credible enough that the triple <hi>Paſce,</hi> given him in charge, enjoynes at leaſt a double dilligence, <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Preach,</hi> or rather <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>Catechiſe:</hi> for Sheep and Lambs, muſt be fed. <hi>I magnifie mine Office,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Both theſe conſidered, it muſt needs follow in the third place, that this Dreſſer's Labour, was, <hi>Labor cum ſudore,</hi> a ſoar ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Labour: Who ſweats more then they, who Digg and Delve, and Till the Earth? God impoſeth it on <hi>Adam,</hi>

            <p>The Calling of a Miniſter indeed, is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> but no whit the leſſe laborious in that reſpect. The ſufferings of the Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſufferings of the Body, (as appears by that which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. and by what we read of our Saviour's ſufferings,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.14. Luke 22.44.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44.) So doth the labour of the Soul, exceed all other bodily labour whatſoever, which (although it be great yet it) maintaines ſtrength, preſerves the ſtomach, encreaſeth appetite, and adds vigour to every part; But it is otherwiſe in the labours of the mind, they weaken the natural Powers, waſte vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Spirit, decay the health of Body, and ſhorten Life.</p>
            <p>We read, <hi>John</hi> 8.57. that the Jews told Chriſt, he was not yet 50 years of Age; true, he wanted al moſt 20 years of it, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not much above 30),<note place="margin">John. 5.57.</note> and yet (as it ſeems) by their ſpeech they judged him to be much Elder: The care and pains that he took to ſave Souls (think ſome) brought on him that ſhew of old Age: Sure enough it is, that the care and pains of this Calling haſtens Old Age on them, who, by natural temper, are framed to greateſt vigour, and fitted to extend Life to the utmoſt term of nature: And thence it is, that (uſually) ſuch Miniſters as are painful in their Callings, are weak in Body; feeble in ſtrength; ſparing in Dyet; and more ſubject to Diſeaſes then men of other Callings and Profeſſions; So that (as <hi>Syneſius</hi> ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained) they may truly ſay, they carry nothing away with them; but, <hi>bonam Conſcientiam &amp; malam Valetudinem;</hi> A good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a weak and crazed Body.</p>

            <p>To this it is anſwered, that <hi>à facto ad jus non valet conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> It was not done thus or thus,<label type="milestone">

            <p>Secondly, When Chriſt and his Apoſtles Preached the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in <hi>Jury,</hi> all Tythes were in the hands of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and could not by any colour of Law be taken from them; To them they were payed: And many years after the Apoſtles time, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and Scandal enforced the Intermiſſion of Paymen, but the Right was not infringed; For afterward, when God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to grant a little reſt, and breathing time to the Church, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently came Tythes again to the Miniſter's portion.</p>
            <p>But doth not our Saviour task the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for Tything of <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi>

               </label> as the words following ſhew, <hi>Theſe things you ought to have done:</hi> whereby Chriſt ſignifies (not obſcurely) that this manner of Tything in kind, and without Diminution, (even for theſe ſmall things, and much more for greater), was in uſe even untill that time, and was Juſt and Lawful; It was their Hypocriſie that our Saviour reproves, in ſtanding ſo ſtrictly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the doing of outward Dutyes (which were onely a little coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them), but more weighty matters they were careleſſe of; They were exact, in that which concerned the Tenth part of their Eſtare, and no more; But they were remiſſe in general, for juſt dealing with all other men, and in other matters of the Law.</p>
            <p>But we have heard (from you) before,<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>

            <p>Needs muſt it be a wrong (and a great wrong too,) to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their dues; for as much as they are part of the wages, which God hath allotted them, for their work.

               <hi>Patranage</hi> into <hi>Pillage;</hi> Truſt, into Treachery; defrauding God ſpoyling his Church, and wronging his Servants, by ſeeking, in their Preſentations, their own filthy gain and lucre?

Corrupt Patrons are thoſe I blame.</p>
            <p>Such a one was he (of whom (divers years ſince) I heard a very godly Divine make this Relation) who having a good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his gift, and then vacant, (and where he himſelf did dwel) had conference with a friend of his about it, and deſired him to think of ſome poor knave, that would be content to take a, ſet ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of 50 or 60 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> and that the Tythes (which were worth as much more at leaſt,) ſhould be left to him to diſpoſe of, at his pleaſure: This Friend being acquainted with one that uſed to read, here and there, Service on the Lord's day (as he was deſired) in the City; acquaints him with the motion, which is very thankfully embraced by him. But to avoid the danger of the Oath, (which was in thoſe daies given to ſuch as were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Livings,) againſt Symony: The Patron muſt not be ſpoken withall, by his Clerk that he did preſent; All was done;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:115536:212"/>the Poſſeſſion given; and Harveſt being come, the Miniſter (that poor Knave) underſtanding the worth of the Living, demands his Tythes of the Patron: How (ſaid the Patron)? Did not my Friend and yours acquaint you with my mind? Yea, ſaid the other, He told me that you deſired to hear of ſome poor Knave, that would accept of your Liuing; and that I was <hi>poor</hi> all <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> knowes; and whether I am <hi>a Knave or no,</hi> judge you: For I will not ſtand to that agreement which I made with him.

            <p>Secondly, That the Compoſition be reaſonable and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that is, anſwerable (at leaſt) to the preſent worth of what is redeemed or compounded for.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it be but for a time, and, at the utmoſt, that it determines with the preſent Incumbent; who is but the <hi>Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructuary,</hi> and not the <hi>Proprietary,</hi> of Tythes, he hath but the Uſe for a time, the Inheritance is God's alone; Wherefore care muſt be had, that nothing be done by any Miniſter which may be prejudicial to God's Inheritance, nor to the Rights and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of his Church: If care be not taken, within few Ages God ſhall have no Tythes in kind to maintain his Church and Miniſters, but all will be turned into Cuſtoms and Preſcriptions; For when the finger of Covetouſneſſe is once gotten into that which is God's, upon a little continuance (if allowed), Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will think it hath hold faſt enough to pluck it wholly from the Church, nor will it let go its hold without much rapping: To this purpoſe I have heard a Scottiſh Lord ſhould ſpeak to one of their Divines, who condoled the baſe maintenance of their Miniſtry, and pleaded for Tythes; You (ſaid the Lord unto him) have preached Tythes into our Purſes, and now that they are in, you ſhall never, with all your Preaching, pull them out again.</p>
            <p>Within theſe few years, the general deſire of this, and ſome other Counties, was for a Compoſition with the Miniſter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Tythes, under a pretence of Peace and Quiet, both of the one and other; Miniſter and People: And what ſhould this Compoſition be? Why, for ſo much as the Soyle would naturally yield, and bring forth of it ſelf, without the charge of Tillage or Manuring; which is that you call the tenth of the Rent, or two Shillings in the Pound; and that the Landlord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: for in letting of his Lands, he ſo letteth them, as to pay that burthen which lyeth on them; ſo doth the ſeller, in making ſale of his, at any time, (for if that burthen were taken off, the Purchaſe or Rent ſhould be raiſed accordingly.) This was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally deſired; Petitions, with many hands thereto, preferred; much mony, in ſome parts of this our County, gathered to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the buſineſſe:<note place="margin">Non ignota cano.</note> And in all likelihood, that Petition had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, had not divers <hi>Impropriators,</hi> then preſent in Parliament (in
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115536:213"/>reſpect of their own intereſt ſay ſome) made ſtop of it: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, many Miniſters (eſpecially in this part of our County, <hi>Ad faciendum populum,</hi>) willing to accomodate their People in their deſires, (as they had need, coming into their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings upon a tickle Title,) condiſcended to their People's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, who now groan under the miſchief of it, finding it experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally true, that the taking of their maintenance in that way which is allowed and appointed by the Magiſtrate, for thoſe who labour in the Word and Doctrine, is the ſafeſt, ſureſt, eaſieſt, and ſpeedieſt way (as before was ſaid): But ſtill the covetous deſires of many are unſatiable, and think they are not low enough; they deal by their Miniſter, in their Compoſitions, as we do by an Onyon, take off Pill after Pill, ſo long till they leave nothing but tears in the Eye; Or elſe, if they promiſe payment (for what they have compounded), they are ſo long about it (like the School-boy who is about to receive his payment from his Maſter, ſo long in fumbling about his Hole) that the Miniſter (like the Maſter), weary with long ſtay, had rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, than to wait ſo long upon them, or ſend ſo often to them for it.</p>
            <p>But, be it known unto you, that theſe and the like unjuſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, are not onely <hi>Injury</hi> to men, but <hi>Impiety</hi> againſt God. The ſtyle of all ancient Deeds and Grants, belonging to the Church, run in this form, <hi>We have given unto God,</hi>

            <p>And being entered into this painful Calling; let them ſee that they take pains in it: We Preach againſt idleneſſe in other Callings, and ſhall we our ſelves be addicted to ſo baſe a ſin?

Oh good Pulpit! how haſt thou offended the Cannons of Chriſt's Church? If thou wert an ambling Nagg, they would ride thee; if a Bed of doun, they would ſleep on thee; if a good Garment, they would weare thee: Alas, good Pulpit, what haſt thou done, that none would come near thee to Preach in thee? Shall any Pulpit in theſe dayes complain againſt any Pulpit-man after that manner: when we have more abilities, more knowledge then they in thoſe Dayes? Our Pulpits in theſe Dayes, are better ſupplyed then formerly; Yet by the like <hi>Proſopopeia,</hi> we may ſpeak to the <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi> Oh!

               <hi>There is no Peace to the Wicked;</hi> and bids defyance to ſuch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.21. and not a word of Comfort in the Scripture to ſuch as <hi>regard wickedneſs in their hearts,</hi> Pſal. 66.18.<note place="margin">Pſal. 66.18 Pſal. 137.4</note> And how then <hi>ſhall we ſing the Lord</hi>'s <hi>ſong in a ſtrange Land?</hi> Say that one be deſperately ſick, and at the point of Death; ſhould another come and tell him of Lordſhips, Mannors, great Purchaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would not this be unſeaſonably ſpoken? would he not (at leaſt, might he not) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Redde me ſanum, tum Fac me divitem;</hi> firſt reſtore me to health, then tell me of Purchaſes: Moſt mens Souls are ſick of ſin, and at Death's door; Never tell them of Heaven, and an Immortal Kingdome, till they be firſt recovered from the jawes of Hell, and delivered out of the ſnares of the Devil.

            <p>Secondly, We are deceived in thinking that by vertue of our Commiſſion, we have not to meddle with Legal comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or threatnings, or are not thereby called to denounce dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt impenitent ones; <hi>He that believeth,</hi>

And ſo,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Intentionally</hi> we Preach nothing but Salvation we never Preach the Law but with reference, and manuduction unto Chriſt; and ſo we manage the diſpenſation of it, that it ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be an <hi>Appendant</hi> on the Goſpel.</p>

No kind of Preaching finds more oppoſition, than this manner of plain Preaching; and the reaſon is, for that by it the eye of the Soul comes to be opened, and a man's ſins and abominations are better diſcovered thereby, then otherwiſe they would. It is in this caſe as it was with <hi>Tully,</hi> who pleading againſt <hi>Verres</hi> for his bribery; omitted his uſual Oratory, and Rhetorical Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and put the Caſe in plain terms, produced the Witneſſes, ſaying, This is the Crime and the Accuſation, who can gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay

St. <hi>Paul</hi> had great grief for the rejection of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.2.

The Word, preached in any place, doth uſually work beſt at firſt: And ſuch Miniſters as God hath made moſt fruitfull in their Miniſtry, have found it experimentally true, that God hath converted more to himſelf, by their labours, upon their first coming amongſt a People, than afterwards; and that their labours afterwards have ſerved, rather to confirm and build up, than to convert and turn to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It would be remembred, that to whom God hath given the means of Grace, and they long enjoyed them, but are never the better for them (but the worſe rather), albeit others have got much good, and profited thereby; To ſuch it is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sign of <hi>Induration,</hi> and future Deſtruction, as theſe Texts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 28. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.28, 30. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.13, 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.47. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. &amp; 13.5.</p>
            <p>Yet, thirdly, None may conclude from hence, that all ſuch are Reprobates, and ſhall certainly periſh, that have long enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the means without profit: For albeit it may be ſaid of ſuch men, their eſtate is very dangerous for the preſent, and that if they dy in that eſtate, they carry with them to their Grave as fearfull a mark and note of Reprobation, as any we can find in the whole Book of God (ſaith my former Author); yet,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hilder.</hi>

            <p>Let us lay the blame where it ſhould be laid, which is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Miniſter, but in the Unfitneſſe and Indiſpoſition of the Hearer. The Potion that was prepared for the cure of a Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, may be ſo far from doing of him good, as that it may haſten his end through his own Indiſpoſedneſſe, but then the Phyſitian is not to be blamed for it: For (as it hath been ſaid of old) three things there are, materially conſiderable in every cure; Firſt the

But if the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> and the <hi>Patient</hi> joyn; the one preſcribing aright, and the other following his directions; down goes the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> the <hi>Patient</hi> recovers: <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>Sickneſſe of the Soul,</hi> whereof every man is a <hi>Patient; God</hi> is the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> who heals us by the hands of his Miniſters; Now if the <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> for the <hi>Patient</hi>'s fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe and obſtinacy, joyn with the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> juſtly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin with Sin (as he often doth), then the Soul is loſt: If the <hi>Patient</hi> joyns with his <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> The Sinner makes much of his Sin, and will not forgo it, nor follow the Rules preſcribed for the mortifying and ſubduing of it; here the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is diſcredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not becauſe the Phyſitian is unskilfull, but the Patient wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: But if the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> and the <hi>Patient</hi> joyn; If <hi>Chriſt preach,</hi> and <hi>Mary repents;</hi> If Chriſt promiſeth, and the Sinner believes, then out goes the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> though it were as ſtrong as ſeven Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels; ſo that much lyes in the Patient. If we take our Sin's part againſt God and his Word, we periſh; If we take God's part againſt our Sins, we are ſaved.

            <p>The <hi>Bad Angels,</hi> the Devils are likewiſe God's Agents and Inſtruments of his wrath; An <hi>evil ſpirit</hi> it was that vexed <hi>Saul,</hi> but that ſpirit was ſent from God to do it; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.14.</note> A <hi>lying ſpirit</hi> was in the mouth of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets, to ſeduce him, but it was God that put that lying ſpirit into their mouths; He ſent it forth, and gave it a Commiſſion to do what it did,<note place="margin">1 King. 22.22, 23.</note> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.22, 23.

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:115536:255"/>Houſes were filled with the dead Carkaſſes of Infants and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; And multitudes caſt over the Walls into the Ditches of the City, for that the Earth could not contain their Dead. Which when <hi>Titus</hi> ſaw, and that the putrefaction ſwamm upon the brim of the Ditch, he lifted up his eyes and hands to Heaven, and with a deep ſigh he called God to witneſſe, that it was not his cruelty, but the Judgment of God upon them for their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being brought thus low with Sedition, Famine, and Peſtilence; was now ready to become a prey unto the Enemy: who perceiving that the Jews did not appear upon the Walls as in former times, cauſed his Engins of battery to be brought, and at length with great difficulty won one Wall, and then another, at laſt a third; He took the Tower of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and there pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Garriſon; And the North-Gate, which they burnt down with fire: They made a breach into the Temple, and firſt fired the Gate of it (which was all covered over with Gold and Silver), Then the Soldiers three Days after fired the Temple it ſelf, which was ſeven years a Building; and which <hi>Titus</hi> would fain have ſaved for the ſumptuouſneſſe of it, but could not.</p>
            <p>After this, he won the lower City, whereof <hi>Johannes Giſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi> had the Command, to whom he before had made a ſpeech gently entreating him to leave off his Rebellion, and the City ſhould be ſpared, and no more outrages committed; but it lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prevailed: whereupon in a rage he gave the ſignal to his Souldiers, who with Fire and Sword conſumed it, and within a ſhort ſpace after took <hi>Giſcalenus</hi> alive, whom he reſerved for a more cruel death.</p>
            <p>The inferiour City being thus taken and deſtroyed, he began to batter the Walls of the upper City, which, within the ſpace of eighteen dayes after, with great labour and skill he layd flat to the Ground, waſting all with Fire and Sword; ſparing neither Man, Woman, nor Child; not leaving <hi>one ſtone upon another:</hi> Only, the three Towers which were built by <hi>Herod,</hi> viz. <hi>Hippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Phaſelus,</hi> and <hi>Mariamxe</hi> (which were all of ſhining marble) were left ſtanding, that future Ages ſeeing the ſtatelineſſe of thoſe Buildings, might judge of the reſt: But theſe were alſo deſtroyed afterwards by <hi>Adricanus Caeſar.</hi>

<pb n="491" facs="tcp:115536:256"/>eaven reckonings with them in every particular of our Saviour's ſufferings, but alſo kept the preciſe Day, and place of payment; beginning firſt with <hi>Galilee</hi> (Chriſt's own Country), the place where Chriſt firſt preached the Goſpel of the Kingdome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Power of his Deity by many Signs and Wonders: but becauſe his Countrymen ſhewed leaſt reſpect unto his Perſon, and gave leaſt credit unto his Doctrine; it ſo fell out by the juſt Judgment of God, that the <hi>Galileans</hi> firſt ſmarted for their unbelief, the whole Country being ſpoyled and waſted by <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi>

            <p>And whereas his Blood was ſold for money, the Blood of many of them was ſhed for money.

            <p>The Death which they put Chriſt unto, was the Death of the Croſſe, they hang him on a Tree.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reſp. </seg>
               </label> ſo we ought to conform unto it. Thus <hi>David</hi> faſted and prayed for his Child that was begotten in Adultery, notwithſtanding the prediction of <hi>Nathan;</hi> for that he underſtood conditionally, (as other threatnings, of like nature, were to be underſtood,) but when he certainly underſtood, by the event, that God had determined the Child ſhould not live; he then riſeth from the Earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he lay, he waſheth himſelf, and changeth his apparell, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the Houſe of God, and worſhippeth; then home to his own Houſe to eat meat, and now refuſeth no comfort, (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would take none,) to the admiration of his Servants; and being demanded the reaſon of this ſtrange Change and Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; He tells them, <hi>Whilſt the Child was yet alive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>I faſted and wept; for I ſaid, Who can tell, whether the Lord will be gratious unto me, that the Child may live? But now he is dead, wherefore ſhould I faſt, Can I bring him back again? I ſhall go to him, he ſhall not return to me,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.22, 23. Upon which paſſage, a very learned and religious Biſhop of our Church hath this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notation; Till we know the determination of the Almighty,<note place="margin">B. B. Hall.

<pb n="498" facs="tcp:115536:260"/>when once we know them, it is out Duty to ſit down in a ſilent contentation.</p>
            <p>Whilſt there is any hope of converting a Sinner, or doing any good unto his Soul, all means are to be uſed; all waies are to be tryed, all Patience to be practiſed, and all Wiſdom to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all occaſions to be taken, that probably may prevail to do him good; ſtill a wicked man is to be pityed, ſtill to be loved, ſtill to be mourned for, and wiſhed well unto; and whoſo is wanting in his duty herein, hath much to anſwer for before God: None may give over uſing the means of a Sinner's reclaiming, till there be no hope at all; And there is hope whilſt there is life: Should God, in deed, reveal unto the Church the Reprobation of any Sinner (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>),<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>lib.</hi> 22. <hi>de civ.

Yet, by the Event, God revealeth His Juſtice, and cut off all hope of amendment by death; And in ſuch a Caſe, we ſhould reſt contented, and bleſs His Name for their ruine.</p>
            <p>But this Doctrine makes againſt Chriſtian Charity, which teacheth us to lament for the miſery of Sinners,<label type="milestone">

How often hath a wiſe Judge paſſed Sentence upon a Malefactor, with tears in his Eyes? being moved with indignation as they are Malefactors, but with compaſſion as they are miſerable men; Green wood, laid upon
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:115536:260"/>the fire, both weeps and burns; it weeps at the ends, and burns in the middle: A deep Vally is clear on the one ſide, yet cloudy on the other; ſo may a Chriſtian mourn in one reſpect, and grieve in another: When <hi>Joſeph</hi> fell upon his Brother <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi>'s neck, his Eyes were full of tears, when his heart was full of Joy. Theſe works of Juſtice are like to thoſe double-faced pictures; look upon them one way, and you may behold an ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhape and viſage; change your poſture, and look upon them another way, and you ſhall ſee a faire and beautiful Perſon: Look up to God, and we have cauſe to rejoyce; Look upon a Sinner, and there is great cauſe to mourn (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>).<note place="margin">Luther <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 39.</note> In ſhort, we are to be affected in all Judgments that are inflicted on Sinners, as the Author of them is; who delights not in them as they make the Creature miſerable, but as they make His Juſtice glorious: Now let us apply the Poynt.</p>

It is a Leſſon, I know, very hard for Fleſh and Blood to learn: By nature, we are apt to queſtion the Righteouſneſſe of God, (at leaſt, ſecretly in our hearts,) in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of His Judgments,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.5.</note> as the Apoſtle intimates <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Is God unrighteous, that taketh Vengeance?

But why ſpeak I of vain and wicked men? We ſhall find, that the very beſt of us are to ſeek in this Leſſon: we are too too apt to murmur and repine at his corrections, and be diſcontented with His Judgments, as if they were too rigorous and ſevere; and ſo we judge, not only of ſuch as are inflicted on our ſelves, (as did <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>)
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:115536:261"/>but oftentimes, of thoſe which are inflicted upon others. <hi>David</hi> was greatly diſpleaſed, becauſe the Lord ſmore <hi>

            <p>But let us now take forth a new Leſſon, and learn to praiſe God for ſhewing Himſelf ſevere, as well as gentle; for his Acts of Juſtice, as well as for His Acts of Mercy: The good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man is commended for his good Husbandry, in the cutting away dry and withered branches, as well as in pruning thoſe which are fruitful; It is one of God's glorious works, to <hi>cut up,</hi> and <hi>root out,</hi> ſuch Trees as hurt and annoy His Vineyard, as it is to <hi>plant</hi> and <hi>ſet</hi> his Vineyard with the choiſeſt Plants; and it is as great a fault to robb Him in the one, as in the other. You know how we extoll Princes, when they declare themſelves to be wholly devoted to right, ſo that if their neareſt Favourites do things worthy of death, they deliver them up to the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, in ſlaying his Minion <hi>Irene,</hi> whom he dearly loved, with his own hand, and in the ſight of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was highly magnified by them for that Act: Let the King of Kings enjoy the Praiſe of his juſt and ſevere Executions: He looks for Prayſe, not onely from <hi>Heaven,</hi> but from <hi>Hell;</hi> As Heaven is for the Praiſe of his Mercy, ſo is Hell for the Praiſe of his Juſtice. <hi>The Righteous ſhall rejoyce</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi>
